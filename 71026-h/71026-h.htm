<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind">
THERE are three main streams of thought which are relevant to the theme
of this enquiry; they may, with sufficient accuracy, be termed the
scientific, the mathematical, and the philosophical movements.
</p>
<p>
Modern speculative physics with its revolutionary theories concerning
the natures of matter and of electricity has made urgent the question,
What are the ultimate data of science? It is in accordance with the
nature of things that mankind should find itself acting and should then
proceed to discuss the rationale of its activities. Thus the creation of
science precedes the analysis of its data and can even be accompanied by
the acceptance of faulty analyses, though such errors end by warping
scientific imagination.
</p>
<p>
The contributions of mathematics to natural science consist in the
elaboration of the general art of deductive reasoning, the theory of
quantitative measurement by the use of number, the theory of serial
order, of geometry, of the exact measurement of time, and of rates of
change. The critical studies of the nineteenth century and after have
thrown light on the nature of mathematics and in particular on the
foundations of geometry. We now know many alternative sets of axioms
from which geometry can be deduced by the strictest deductive reasoning.
But these investigations concern geometry as an abstract science deduced
from hypothetical premisses. In this enquiry we are concerned with
geometry as a physical science. How is space rooted in experience?
</p>
<p>
The modern theory of relativity has opened the possibility of a new
answer to this question. The successive labours of Larmor, Lorentz,
Einstein, and Minkovski have opened a new world of thought as to the
relations of space and time to the ultimate data of perceptual
knowledge. The present work is largely concerned with providing a
physical basis for the more modern views which have thus emerged. The
whole investigation is based on the principle that the scientific
concepts of space and time are the first outcome of the simplest
generalisations from experience, and that they are not to be looked for
at the tail end of a welter of differential equations. This position
does not mean that Einstein's recent theory of general relativity and of
gravitation is to be rejected. The divergence is purely a question of
interpretation. Our time and space measurements may in practice result
in elaborate combinations of the primary methods of measurement which
are explained in this work. For example, the theory of gravitational
matter may involve the theory of 'vagrant solids' which is pointed out
as a subject for investigation in <a href="#art39">article 39</a>, but
not developed. It has certainly resulted from Einstein's investigations
that a modification of the gravitational law, of an order of magnitude
which is <img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 5.183ex; height: 2.452ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v^{2}/c^{2}"> of the main effect [<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v"> being the velocity of
the matter and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> that of light], will account for the more striking
outstanding difficulties otherwise unexplained by the law of
gravitation. This is a remarkable discovery for which the utmost credit
is due to the author. Now that the fact is known, it is easy to see that
it is the sort of modification which on the simple electromagnetic
theory of relativity is likely to be required for this law. I have
however been anxious to disentangle the consideration of the main
positions of this enquiry from theories designed to explain special laws
of nature. Also at the date of writing the evidence for some of the
consequences of Einstein's theory is ambiguous and even adverse. In
connection with the theory of relativity I have received suggestive
stimulus from Dr L. Silberstein's <i>Theory of Relativity</i>, and from
an important Memoir<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
by Profs. E. B. Wilson and G. N. Lewis.
</p>
<p>
The discussion of the deduction of scientific concepts from the simplest
elements of our perceptual knowledge at once brings us to philosophical
theory. Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Mill, Huxley, Bertrand Russell and
Bergson, among others, have initiated and sustained relevant
discussions. But this enquiry is touched by only one side of the
philosophical debate. We are concerned only with Nature, that is, with
the object of perceptual knowledge, and not with the synthesis of the
knower with the known. This distinction is exactly that which separates
natural philosophy from metaphysics. Accordingly none of our
perplexities as to Nature will be solved by having recourse to the
consideration that there is a mind knowing it. Our theme is the
coherence of the known, and the perplexity which we are unravelling is
as to what it is that is known. In matters philosophic the obligations
of an author to others usually arise from schools of debate rather than
from schools of agreement. Also such schools are the more important in
proportion as assertion and retort do not have to wait for the
infrequent opportunities of formal publication, hampered by the
formidable permanence of the printed word. At the present moment England
is fortunate in this respect. London, Oxford and Cambridge are within
easy reach of each other, and provide a common school of debate which
rivals schools of the ancient and medieval worlds. Accordingly I have
heavy obligations to acknowledge to Bertrand Russell, Wildon Carr, F. C.
Schiller, T. P. Nunn, Dawes Hicks, McTaggart, James Ward, and many
others who, amid their divergencies of opinion, are united in the candid
zeal of their quest for truth.
</p>
<p>
It is quite unnecessary to draw attention to the incompleteness of this
investigation. The book is merely an enquiry. It raises more
difficulties than those which it professes to settle. This is inevitable
in any philosophical work, however complete. All that one can hope to do
is to settle the right sort of difficulties and to raise the right sort
of ulterior questions, and thus to accomplish one short step further
into the unfathomable mystery.
</p>
<p>
Memories are short, and perhaps it is not inapt to put on record
circumstances common to the life of all England during years of war. The
book is the product of intervals of leisure amid pressing occupation, a
refuge from immediate fact. It has been thought out and written amid the
sound of guns&mdash;guns of Kitchener's army training on Salisbury
Plain, guns on the Somme faintly echoing across the Sussex coast: some
few parts composed to pass times of expectation during air-raids over
London, punctuated by the sound of bombs and the answer of artillery,
with argument clipped by the whirr of aeroplanes. And through the land
anxiety, and at last the anguish which is the price of victory.

<h2>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>

<p class="nind">
Since the publication of the first edition of this book in 1919, the
various topics contained in it have been also considered by me in <i>The
Concept of Nature</i> (Camb. Univ. Press, 1920) and in <i>The Principle
of Relativity</i> (Camb. Univ. Press, 1922). I hope in the immediate
future to embody the standpoint of these volumes in a more complete
metaphysical study.

A few notes have been appended to this edition to elucidate obscurities,
and a few slips in the text have been corrected.

<h2><a id="part01">PART I</a>
<br>
THE TRADITIONS OF SCIENCE</h2>

<h2><a id="chap01">CHAPTER I</a>
<br>
MEANING</h2>

<p>
<a id="art01"><b><i>1. Traditional Scientific Concepts</i></b></a>.
<b>1.1</b> What is a physical explanation? The answer to this question,
even when merely implicit in the scientific imagination, must profoundly
affect the development of every science, and in an especial degree that
of speculative physics. During the modern period the orthodox answer has
invariably been couched in terms of Time (flowing equably in measurable
lapses) and of Space (timeless, void of activity, euclidean), and of
Material in space (such as matter, ether, or electricity).
</p>
<p>
The governing principle underlying this scheme is that extension, namely
extension in time or extension in space, expresses disconnection. This
principle issues in the assumptions that causal action between entities
separated in time or in space is impossible and that extension in space
and unity of being are inconsistent. Thus the extended material (on this
view) is essentially a multiplicity of entities which, as extended, are
diverse and disconnected. This governing principle has to be limited in
respect to extension in time. The same material exists at different
times. This concession introduces the many perplexities centering round
the notion of change which is derived from the comparison of various
states of self-identical material at different times.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art1.2"><b>1.2</b></a> The ultimate fact embracing all nature is
(in this traditional point of view) a distribution of material
throughout all space at a durationless instant of time, and another such
ultimate fact will be another distribution of the same material
throughout the same space at another durationless instant of time. The
difficulties of this extreme statement are evident and were pointed out
even in classical times when the concept first took shape. Some
modification is evidently necessary. No room has been left for velocity,
acceleration, momentum, and kinetic energy, which certainly are
essential physical quantities.
</p>
<p>
We must therefore in the ultimate fact, beyond which science ceases to
analyse, include the notion of a state of change. But a state of change
at a durationless instant is a very difficult conception. It is
impossible to define velocity without some reference to the past and the
future. Thus change is essentially the importation of the past and of
the future into the immediate fact embodied in the durationless present
instant.
</p>
<p>
This conclusion is destructive of the fundamental assumption that the
ultimate facts for science are to be found at durationless instants of
time.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.3</b> The reciprocal causal action between materials <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A"> and
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="B"> is the fact that their states of change are partly dependent on
their relative locations and natures. The disconnection involved in
spatial separation leads to reduction of such causal action to the
transmission of stress across the bounding surface of contiguous
materials. But what is contact? No two points are in contact. Thus the
stress across a surface necessarily acts on some bulk of the material
enclosed inside. To say that the stress acts on the immediately
contiguous material is to assert infinitely small volumes. But there are
no such things, only smaller and smaller volumes. Yet (with this point
of view) it cannot be meant that the surface acts on the interior.
</p>
<p>
Certainly stress has the same claim to be regarded as an essential
physical quantity as have momentum and kinetic energy. But no
intelligible account of its meaning is to be extracted from the concept
of the continuous distribution of diverse (because extended) entities
through space as an ultimate scientific fact. At some stage in our
account of stress we are driven to the concept of any extended quantity
of material as a single unity whose nature is partly explicable in terms
of its surface stress.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.4</b> In biology the concept of an organism cannot be expressed in
terms of a material distribution at an instant. The essence of an
organism is that it is one thing which functions and is spread through
space. Now functioning takes time. Thus a biological organism is a unity
with a spatio-temporal extension which is of the essence of its being.
This biological conception is obviously incompatible with the
traditional ideas. This argument does not in any way depend on the
assumption that biological phenomena belong to a different category to
other physical phenomena. The essential point of the criticism on
traditional concepts which has occupied us so far is that the concept of
unities, functioning and with spatio-temporal extensions, cannot be
extruded from physical concepts. The only reason for the introduction of
biology is that in these sciences the same necessity becomes more clear.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.5</b> The fundamental assumption to be elaborated in the course of
this enquiry is that the ultimate facts of nature, in terms of which all
physical and biological explanation must be expressed, are events
connected by their spatio-temporal relations, and that these relations
are in the main reducible to the property of events that they can
contain (or extend over) other events which are parts of them. In other
words, in the place of emphasising space and time in their capacity of
disconnecting, we shall build up an account of their complex essences as
derivative from the ultimate ways in which those things, ultimate in
science, are interconnected. In this way the data of science, those
concepts in terms of which all scientific explanation must be expressed,
will be more clearly apprehended. But before proceeding to our
constructive task, some further realisation of the perplexities
introduced by the traditional concepts is necessary.

<a id="art02"><b><i>2. Philosophic Relativity</i></b></a>. <b>2.1</b>
The philosophical principle of the relativity of space means that the
properties of space are merely a way of expressing relations between
things ordinarily said to be 'in space.' Namely, when two things are
said to be 'both in space' what is meant is that they are mutually
related in a certain definite way which is termed 'spatial.' It is an
immediate consequence of this theory that all spatial entities such as
points, straight lines and planes are merely complexes of relations
between things or of possible relations between things.
</p>
<p>
For consider the meaning of saying that a particle <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> is at a point
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.79ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q">. This statement conveys substantial information and must therefore
convey something more than the barren assertion of self-identity '<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">
is <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">.' Thus what must be meant is that <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> has certain relations
to other particles <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">′, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">″, etc., and that the
abstract possibility of this group of relations is what is meant by the
point <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.79ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q">.
</p>
<p>
The extremely valuable work on the foundations of geometry produced
during the nineteenth century has proceeded from the assumption of
points as ultimate given entities. This assumption, for the logical
purpose of mathematicians, is entirely justified. Namely the
mathematicians ask, What is the logical description of relations between
points from which all geometrical theorems respecting such relations can
be deduced? The answer to this question is now practically complete; and
if the old theory of absolute space be true, there is nothing more to be
said. For points are ultimate simple existents, with mutual relations
disclosed by our perceptions of nature.
</p>
<p>
But if we adopt the principle of relativity, these investigations do not
solve the question of the foundations of geometry. An investigation into
the foundations of geometry has to explain space as a complex of
relations between things. It has to describe what a point is, and has to
show how the geometric relations between points issue from the ultimate
relations between the ultimate things which are the immediate objects of
knowledge. Thus the starting point of a discussion on the foundations of
geometry is a discussion of the character of the immediate data of
perception. It is not now open to mathematicians to assume <i>sub
silentio</i> that points are among these data.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.2</b> The traditional concepts were evidently formed round the
concept of absolute space, namely the concept of the persistent ultimate
material distributed among the persistent ultimate points in successive
configurations at successive ultimate instants of time. Here
ultimate' means 'not analysable into a complex of simpler entities.'
The introduction of the principle of relativity adds to the
complexity&mdash;or rather, to the perplexity&mdash;of this conception
of nature. The statement of general character of ultimate fact must now
be amended into 'persistent ultimate material with successive mutual
ultimate relations at successive ultimate instants of time.'
</p>
<p>
Space issues from these mutual relations of matter at an instant. The
first criticism to be made on such an assertion is that it is shown to
be a metaphysical fairy tale by any comparison with our actual
perceptual knowledge of nature. Our knowledge of space is based on
observations which take time and have to be successive, but the
relations which constitute space are instantaneous. The theory demands
that there should be an instantaneous space corresponding to each
instant, and provides for no correlation between these spaces; while
nature has provided us with no apparatus for observing them.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.3</b> It is an obvious suggestion that we should amend our statement of
ultimate fact, as modified by the acceptance of relativity. The spatial
relations must now stretch across time. Thus if <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">′,

<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.804ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/9.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{2}">, as well as such relations between <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">′ and

<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">′ and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">″, etc. at time <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.804ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/9.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{2}">. This
should mean that <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> at time <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.804ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/9.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{2}"> has a definite position in the
spatial configuration constituted by the relations between <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">′,
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">″, etc. at time <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 1.804ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/8.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{1}">. For example, the sun at a
certain instant on Jan. 1st, 1900 had a definite position in the
instantaneous space constituted by the mutual relations between the sun and
the other stars at a definite instant on Jan. 1st, 1800. Such a statement
is only understandable (assuming the traditional concept) by recurring to
absolute space and thus abandoning relativity; for otherwise it denies the
completeness of the instantaneous fact which is the essence of the concept.
Another way out of the difficulty is to deny that space is constituted by
the relations of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">′, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">″, etc., at an instant,
and to assert that it results from their relations throughout a duration of
time, which as thus prolonged in time are observable.
</p>
<p>
As a matter of fact it is obvious that our knowledge of space does
result from such observations. But we are asking the theory to provide
us with actual relations to be observed. This last emendation is either
only a muddled way of admitting that 'nature at an instant' is not the
ultimate scientific fact, or else it is a yet more muddled plea that,
although there is no possibility of correlations between distinct
instantaneous spaces, yet within durations which are short enough such
non-existent correlations enter into experience.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.4</b> The persistence of the material lacks any observational
guarantee when the relativity of space is admitted into the traditional
concept. For at one instant there is instantaneous material in its
instantaneous space as constituted by its instantaneous relations, and
at another instant there is instantaneous material in its instantaneous
space. How do we know that the two cargoes of material which load the
two instants are identical? The answer is that we do not perceive
isolated instantaneous facts, but a continuity of existence, and that it
is this observed continuity of existence which guarantees the
persistence of material. Exactly so; but this gives away the whole
traditional concept. For a 'continuity of existence' must mean an
unbroken duration of existence. Accordingly it is admitted that the
ultimate fact for observational knowledge is perception through a
duration; namely, that the content of a specious present, and not that
of a durationless instant, is an ultimate datum for science.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.5</b> It is evident that the conception of the instant of time as an
ultimate entity is the source of all our difficulties of explanation. If
there are such ultimate entities, instantaneous nature is an ultimate
fact.
</p>
<p>
Our perception of time is as a duration, and these instants have only
been introduced by reason of a supposed necessity of thought. In fact
absolute time is just as much a metaphysical monstrosity as absolute
space. The way out of the perplexities, as to the ultimate data of
science in terms of which physical explanation is ultimately to be
expressed, is to express the essential scientific concepts of time,
space and material as issuing from fundamental relations between events
and from recognitions of the characters of events. These relations of
events are those immediate deliverances of observation which are
referred to when we say that events are spread through time and space.

<p>
<a id="art03"><b><i>3. Perception</i></b></a>. <b>3.1</b> The conception
of one universal nature embracing the fragmentary perceptions of events
by one percipient and the many perceptions by diverse percipients is
surrounded with difficulties. In the first place there is what we will
call the 'Berkeleyan Dilemma' which crudely and shortly may be stated
thus: Perceptions are in the mind and universal nature is out of the
mind, and thus the conception of universal nature can have no relevance
to our perceptual life. This is not how Berkeley stated his criticism of
materialism; he was thinking of substance and matter. But this variation
is a detail and his criticism is fatal to any of the traditional types
of 'mind-watching-things' philosophy, even if those things be events and
not substance or material. His criticisms range through every type of
sense-perception, though in particular he concentrates on Vision.

<p class="hanging2">
<b>3.2</b> "<i>Euphranor</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Tell me, Alciphron, can you discern the
doors, windows, and battlements of that same castle?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Alciphron</i>. I cannot. At this distance it seems only a small
round tower.
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Euph</i>. But I, who have been at it, know that it is no small round
tower, but a large square building with battlements and
turrets, which it seems you do not see.
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Alc</i>. What will you infer from thence?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Euph</i>. I would infer that the very object which you strictly and
properly perceive by sight is not that thing which is several
miles distant.
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Alc</i>. Why so?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Euph</i>. Because a little round object is one thing, and a great square
object is another. Is it not so?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Alc</i>. I cannot deny it.
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Euph</i>. Tell me, is not the visible appearance alone the proper
object of sight?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Alc</i>. It is.
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
What think you now (said <i>Euphranor</i>, pointing towards the heavens)
of the visible appearance of yonder planet? Is it not a round luminous
flat, no bigger than a six-pence?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Alc</i>. What then?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Euph</i>. Tell me then, what you think of the planet itself? Do you not
conceive it to be a vast opaque globe, with several unequal risings and
valleys?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Alc</i>. I do.
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Euph</i>. How can you therefore conclude that the proper object of your
sight exists at a distance?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Alc</i>. I confess I do not know.
</p>
<p class="hanging2">

perceive anything like what you now see?
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Alc</i>. By no means. I should perceive only a dark mist.
</p>
<p class="hanging2">
<i>Euph</i>. Is it not plain, therefore, that neither the castle, the
planet, nor the cloud, which you see here, are those real ones which you
suppose exist at a distance?"
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>3.3</b> Now the difficulty to be faced is just this. We may not lightly
abandon the castle, the planet, and the crimson cloud, and hope to
retain the eye, its retina, and the brain. Such a philosophy is too
simple-minded&mdash;or at least might be thought so, except for its wide
diffusion.
</p>
<p>
Suppose we make a clean sweep. Science then becomes a formula for
calculating mental 'phenomena' or 'impressions.' But where is
science? In books? But the castle and the planet took their libraries
with them.
</p>
<p>
No, science is in the minds of men. But men sleep and forget, and at
their best in any one moment of insight entertain but scanty thoughts.
Science therefore is nothing but a confident expectation that relevant
thoughts will occasionally occur. But by the bye, what has happened to
time and space? They must have gone after the other things. No, we must
distinguish: space has gone, of course; but time remains as relating the
succession of phenomena. Yet this won't do; for this succession is
only known by recollection, and recollection is subject to the same
criticism as that applied by Berkeley to the castle, the planet, and the
cloud. So after all, time does evaporate with space, and in their
departure 'you' also have accompanied them; and I am left solitary
in the character of a void of experience without significance.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.4</b> At this point in the argument we may break off, having formed a
short catalogue of the sort of considerations which lead from the
Berkeleyan dilemma to a complete scepticism which was not in
Berkeley's own thought.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of answer to this sceptical descent. One is Dr
Johnson's. He stamped his foot on a paving-stone, and went on his way
satisfied with its reality. A scrutiny of modern philosophy will, if I
am not mistaken, show that more philosophers should own Dr Johnson as
their master than would be willing to acknowledge their indebtedness.
</p>
<p>
The other type of answer was first given by Kant. We must distinguish
between the general way he set about constructing his answer to Hume,
and the details of his system which in many respects are highly
disputable. The essential point of his method is the assumption that
'significance' is an essential element in concrete experience. The
Berkeleyan dilemma starts with tacitly ignoring this aspect of
experience, and thus with putting forward, as expressing experience,
conceptions of it which have no relevance to fact. In the light of
Kant's procedure, Johnson's answer falls into its place; it is the
assertion that Berkeley has not correctly expounded what experience in
fact is.
</p>
<p>
Berkeley himself insists that experience is significant, indeed
three-quarters of his writings are devoted to enforcing this position.
But Kant's position is the converse of Berkeley's, namely that
significance is experience. Berkeley first analyses experience, and then
expounds his view of its significance, namely that it is God conversing
with us. For Berkeley the significance is detachable from the
experience. It is here that Hume came in. He accepted Berkeley's
assumption that experience is something given, an impression, without
essential reference to significance, and exhibited it in its bare
insignificance. Berkeley's conversation with God then becomes a fairy
tale.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.5</b> What is 'significance'? Evidently this is a fundamental question
for the philosophy of natural knowledge, which cannot move a step until
it has made up its mind as to what is meant by this 'significance'
which is experience.
</p>
<p>
'Significance' is the relatedness of things. To say that significance is
experience, is to affirm that perceptual knowledge is nothing else than
an apprehension of the relatedness of things, namely of things in their
relations and as related. Certainly if we commence with a knowledge of
things, and then look around for their relations we shall not find them.
'Causal connection' is merely one typical instance of the universal ruin
of relatedness. But then we are quite mistaken in thinking that there is
a possible knowledge of things as unrelated. It is thus out of the
question to start with a knowledge of things antecedent to a knowledge
of their relations. The so-called properties of things can always be
expressed as their relatedness to other things unspecified, and natural
knowledge is exclusively concerned with relatedness.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.6</b> The relatedness which is the subject of natural knowledge
cannot be understood without reference to the general characteristics of
perception. Our perception of natural events and natural objects is a
perception from within nature, and is not an awareness contemplating all
nature impartially from without. When Dr Johnson 'surveyed mankind from
China to Peru,' he did it from Pump Court in London at a certain date.
Even Pump Court was too wide for his peculiar <i>locus standi</i>; he
was really merely conscious of the relations of his bodily events to the
simultaneous events throughout the rest of the universe. Thus perception
involves a percipient object, a percipient event, the complete event
which is all nature simultaneous with the percipient event, and the
particular events which are perceived as parts of the complete
event. This general analysis of perception will be elaborated in
<a href="#part02">Part II</a>. The point here to be emphasised is that
natural knowledge is a knowledge from within nature, a knowledge 'here
within nature' and 'now within nature,' and is an awareness of the
natural relations of one element in nature (namely, the percipient
event) to the rest of nature. Also what is known is not barely the
things but the relations of things, and not the relations in the
abstract but specifically those things as related.


</p>
<p>
Thus Alciphron's vision of the planet is his perception of his
relatedness (i.e. the relatedness of his percipient event) to some other
elements of nature which as thus related he calls the planet. He admits
in the dialogue that certain other specified relations of those elements
are possible for other percipient events. In this he may be right or
wrong. What he directly knows is his relation to some other elements of
the universe namely, I, Alciphron, am located in my percipient event
'here and now' and the immediately perceived appearance of the
planet is for me a characteristic of another event 'there and now.'
In fact perceptual knowledge is always a knowledge of the relationship
of the percipient event to something else in nature. This doctrine is in
entire agreement with Dr Johnson's stamp of the foot by which he
realised the otherness of the paving-stone.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.7</b> The conception of knowledge as passive contemplation is too
inadequate to meet the facts. Nature is ever originating its own
development, and the sense of action is the direct knowledge of the
percipient event as having its very being in the formation of its
natural relations. Knowledge issues from this reciprocal insistence
between this event and the rest of nature, namely relations are
perceived in the making and because of the making. For this reason
perception is always at the utmost point of creation. We cannot put
ourselves back to the Crusades and know their events while they were
happening. We essentially perceive our relations with nature because
they are in the making. The sense of action is that essential factor in
natural knowledge which exhibits it as a self-knowledge enjoyed by an
element of nature respecting its active relations with the whole of
nature in its various aspects. Natural knowledge is merely the other
side of action. The forward moving time exhibits this characteristic of
experience, that it is essentially action. This passage of nature&mdash;or,
in other words, its creative advance&mdash;is its fundamental
characteristic; the traditional concept is an attempt to catch nature
without its passage.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.8</b> Thus science leads to an entirely incoherent philosophy of
perception in so far as it restricts itself to the ultimate datum of
material in time and space, the spatio-temporal configuration of such
material being the object of perception. This conclusion is no news to
philosophy, but it has not led to any explicit reorganisation of the
concepts actually employed in science. Implicitly, scientific theory is
shot through and through with notions which are frankly inconsistent
with its explicit fundamental data.
</p>
<p>
This confusion cannot be avoided by any kind of theory in which nature
is conceived simply as a complex of one kind of inter-related elements
such as either persistent things, or events, or sense-data. A more
elaborate view is required of which an explanation will be attempted in
the sequel. It will suffice here to say that it issues in the assertion
that all nature can (in many diverse ways) be analysed as a complex of
things; thus all nature can be analysed as a complex of events, and all
nature can be analysed as a complex of sense-data. The elements which
result from such analyses, events, and sense-data, are aspects of nature
of fundamentally different types, and the confusions of scientific
theory have arisen from the absence of any clear recognition of the
distinction between relations proper to one type of element
and relations proper to another type of element. It is of course a
commonplace that elements of these types are fundamentally different.
What is here to be insisted on is the way in which this commonplace
truth is important in yielding an analysis of the ultimate data for
science more elaborate than that of its current tradition. We have to
remember that while nature is complex with time-less subtlety, human
thought issues from the simple-mindedness of beings whose active life is
less than half a century.

THE FOUNDATIONS OF DYNAMICAL
PHYSICS</h2>

<p>
<a id="art04"><b><i>4. Newton's Laws of Motion</i></b></a>. <b>4.1</b>
The theoretical difficulties in the way of the application of the
philosophic doctrine of relativity have never worried practical
scientists. They have started with the working assumptions that in some
sense the world is in one euclidean space, that the permanent points in
such a space have no individual characteristics recognisable by us,
except so far as they are occupied by recognisable material or except in
so far as they are defined by assigned spatial relations to points which
are thus definitely recognisable, and that according to the purpose in
hand either the earth can be assumed to be at rest or else astronomical
axes which are defined by the aid of the solar system, of the stars, and
of dynamical considerations deduced from Newton's laws of motion.
</p>
<p>
<b>4.2</b> Newton's laws<a id="FNanchor_3_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
of motion presuppose the notions of mass and force. Mass arises from the
conception of a passive quality of a material body, what it is in itself
apart from its relation to other bodies; the notion of 'force' is that
of an active agency changing the physical circumstances of the body, and
in particular its spatial relations to other bodies. It is fairly
obvious that mass and force were introduced into science as the outcome
of this antithesis between intrinsic quality and agency, although
further reflection may somewhat mar the simplicity of this outlook. Mass
and force are measurable quantities, and their numerical expressions are
dependent on the units chosen. The mass of a body is constant, so long
as the body remains composed of the same self-identical material.
Velocity, acceleration and force are vector quantities, namely they have
direction as well as magnitude. They are thus representable by straight
lines drawn from any arbitrary origin.
</p>
<p>
<b>4.3</b> These laws of motion are among the foundations of science; and
certainly any alteration in them must be such as to produce effects
observable only under very exceptional circumstances. But, as is so
often the case in science, a scrutiny of their meaning produces many
perplexities.
</p>
<p>
In the first place we can sweep aside one minor difficulty. In our
experience, a finite mass of matter occupies a volume and not a point.
Evidently therefore the laws should be stated in an integral form,
involving at certain points of the exposition greater elaboration of
statement. These forms are stated (with somewhat abbreviated
explanation) in dynamical treatises.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, Lorentz's distinction between macroscopic equations and
microscopic equations forces itself on us at once, by reason of the
molecular nature of matter and the dynamical nature of heat. A body
apparently formed of continuous matter with its intrinsic geometrical
relations nearly invariable is in fact composed of agitated molecules.
The equations of motion for such a body as used by an engineer or an
astronomer are, in Lorentz's nomenclature, macroscopic. In such
equations even a differential element of volume is to be supposed to be
sufficiently large to average out the diverse agitations of the
molecules, and to register only the general unbalanced residuum which to
ordinary observation is the motion of the body.
</p>
<p>
The microscopic equations are those which apply to the individual
molecules. It is at once evident that a series of such sets of equations
is possible, in which the adjacent sets are macroscopic and microscopic
relatively to each other. For example, we may penetrate below the
molecule to the electrons and the core which compose it, and thus obtain
infra-molecular equations. It is purely a question as to whether there
are any observed phenomena which in this way receive their
interpretation.
</p>
<p>
The inductive evidence for the validity of Newton's equations of
motion, within the experimental limits of accuracy, is obviously much
stronger in the case of the macroscopic equations of the engineer and
the astronomer than it is in the case of the microscopic equations of
the molecule, and very much stronger than in the case of the
infra-microscopic equations of the electron. But there is good evidence
that even the infra-microscopic equations conform to Newton's laws as
a first approximation. The traces of deviation arise when the velocities
are not entirely negligible compared to that of light.
</p>
<p>
<b>4.4</b> What do we know about masses and about forces? We obtain our
knowledge of forces by having some theory about masses, and our
knowledge of masses by having some theory about forces. Our theories
about masses enable us in certain circumstances to assign the numerical
ratios of the masses of the bodies involved; then the observed motions
of these bodies will enable us to register (by the use of Newton's
laws of motion) the directions and magnitudes of the forces involved,
and thence to frame more extended theories as to the laws regulating the
production of force. Our theories about the direction and comparative
magnitudes of forces and the observed motions of the bodies will enable
us to register (by the use of Newton's laws of motion) the comparative
magnitudes of masses. The final results are to be found in engineers'
pocket-books in tables of physical constants for physicists, and in
astronomical tables. The verification is the concordant results of
diverse experiments. One essential part of such theories is the judgment
of circumstances which are sufficiently analogous to warrant the
assumption of the same mass or the same magnitude of force in assigned
diverse cases. Namely the theories depend upon the fact of recognition.
</p>
<p>
<b>4.5</b> It has been popular to define force as the product of mass and
acceleration. The difficulty to be faced with this definition is that
the familiar equation of elementary dynamics, namely,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 8.576ex; height: 2.059ex;" src="images/10.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
mf = P,
"></span>
now becomes
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 10.108ex; height: 2.059ex;" src="images/11.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
mf = mf.
"></span>
It is not easy to understand how an important science can issue from
such premisses. Furthermore the simple balancing of a weight by the
tension of the supporting spring receives a very artificial meaning.
With equal reason we might start with our theories of force as
fundamental, and define mass as force divided by acceleration. Again we
should be in equal danger of reducing dynamical equations to such
identities as
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 11.795ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/12.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
P/f = P/f.
"></span>
Also the permanent mass of a bar of iron receives a very artificial
meaning.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art05"><b><i>5. The Ether</i></b></a>. <b>5.1</b> The theory of
stress between distant bodies, considered as an ultimate fact, was
repudiated by Newton himself, but was adopted by some of his immediate
successors. In the nineteenth century the belief in action at a distance
has steadily lost ground.
</p>
<p>
There are four definite scientific reasons for the adoption of the
opposite theory of the transmission of stress through an intermediate
medium which we will call the 'ether.' These reasons are in addition
to the somewhat vague philosophic preferences, based on the
disconnection involved in spatial and temporal separation. In the first
place, the wave theory of light also postulates an ether, and thus
brings concurrent testimony to its existence. Secondly, Clerk Maxwell
produced the formulae for the stresses in such an ether which, if they
exist, would account for gravitational, electrostatic, and magnetic
attractions. No theory of the nature of the ether is thereby produced
which in any way explains why such stresses exist; and thus their
existence is so far just as much a disconnected assumption as that of
the direct stresses between distant bodies. Thirdly, Clerk Maxwell's
equations of the electromagnetic field presuppose events and physical
properties of apparently empty space. Accordingly there must be
something, i.e. an ether, in the empty space to which these properties
belong. These equations are now recognised as the foundations of the
exact science of electromagnetism, and stand on a level with Newton's
equations of motion. Thus another testimony is added to the existence of
an ether.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, Clerk Maxwell's identification of light with electromagnetic
waves shows that the same ether is required by the apparently diverse
optical and electromagnetic phenomena. The objection is removed that
fresh properties have to be ascribed to the ether by each of the
distinct lines of thought which postulate it.
</p>
<p>
It will be observed that gravitation stands outside this unification of
scientific theory due to Maxwell's work, except so far that we know
the stresses in the ether which would produce it.
</p>
<p>
<b>5.2</b> The assumption of the existence of an ether at once raises
the question as to its laws of motion. Thus in addition to the hierarchy
of macroscopic and microscopic equations, there are the equations of
motion for ether in otherwise empty space. The <i>à priori</i> reasons
for believing that Newton's laws of motion apply to the ether are very
weak, being in fact nothing more than the inductive extension of laws to
cases widely dissimilar from those for which they have been verified. It
is however a sound scientific procedure to investigate whether the
assumed properties of ether are explicable on the assumption that it is
behaving like ordinary matter, if only to obtain suggestions by contrast
for the formulation of the laws which do express its physical changes.
</p>
<p>
The best method of procedure is to assume certain large principles
deducible from Newton's laws and to interpret certain electromagnetic
vectors as displacements and velocities of the ether. In this way Larmor
has been successful in deducing Maxwell's equations from the principle
of least action after making the necessary assumptions. In this he is
only following a long series of previous scientists who during the
nineteenth century devoted themselves to the explanation of optical and
electromagnetic phenomena. His work completes a century of very notable
achievement in this field.
</p>
<p>
<b>5.3</b> But it may be doubted whether this procedure is not an inversion
of the more fundamental line of thought. It will have been noted that
Newton's equations, or any equivalent principles which are substituted
for them, are in a sense merely blank forms. They require to be
supplemented by hypotheses respecting the nature of the stresses, of the
masses, and of the motions, before there can be any possibility of their
application. Thus by the time that Newton's equations of motion are
applied to the explication of etherial events there is a large
accumulation of hypotheses respecting things of which we know very
little. What in fact we do know about the ether is summed up in
Maxwell's equations, or in recent adaptations of his equations such as
those due to Lorentz. The discovery of electromagnetic mass and
electromagnetic momentum suggests that, for the ether at least, we gain
simpler conceptions of the facts by taking Maxwell's equations, or the
Lorentz-Maxwell equations, as fundamental. Such equations would then be
the ultimate microscopic equations, at least in the present stage of
science, and Newton's equations become macroscopic equations which
apply in certain definite circumstances to etherial aggregates. Such a
procedure does not prejudge the debated theory of the purely
electromagnetic origin of mass.
</p>
<p>
<b>5.4</b> The modern theory of the molecule is destructive of the
obviousness of the prejudgment in favour of the traditional concepts of
ultimate material at an instant. Consider a molecule of iron. It is
composed of a central core of positive electricity surrounded by annular
clusters of electrons, composed of negative electricity and rotating
round the core. No single characteristic property of iron as such can be
manifested at an instant. Instantaneously there is simply a distribution
of electricity and Maxwell's equations to express our expectations. But
iron is not an expectation or even a recollection. It is a fact; and
this fact, which is iron, is what happens during a period of time. Iron
and a biological organism are on a level in requiring time for
functioning. There is no such thing as iron at an instant; to be iron is
a character of an event. Every physical constant respecting iron which
appears in scientific tables is the register of such a character. What
is ultimate in iron, according to the traditional theory, is
instantaneous distributions of electricity; and this ultimateness is
simply ascribed by reason of a metaphysical theory, and by no reason of
observation.
</p>
<p>
<b>5.5</b> In truth, when we have once admitted the hierarchy of
macroscopic and microscopic equations, the traditional concept is lost.
For it is the macroscopic equations which express the facts of immediate
observation, and these equations essentially express the integral
characters of events. But this hierarchy is necessitated by every
concept of modern physics&mdash;the molecular theory of matter, the
dynamical theory of heat, the wave theory of light, the electromagnetic
theory of molecules, the electromagnetic theory of mass.

<a id="art06"><b><i>6. Maxwell's Equations</i></b></a><a id="FNanchor_4_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
<a id="art6.1"><b>6.1</b></a> A discussion of Maxwell's equations
would constitute a treatise on electromagnetism. But they exemplify some
general considerations on physical laws.
</p>
<p>
These equations (expressed for an axis-system <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> involve
for each point of space and each instant of time the vector quantities
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 10.76ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F_{\alpha}, G_{\alpha}, H_{\alpha}">),
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 11.199ex; height: 1.984ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="L_{\alpha}, M_{\alpha}, N_{\alpha}">)
and (<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 9.658ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="u_{\alpha}, v_{\alpha}, w_{\alpha}">), namely the electric and
magnetic 'forces' and the velocity of the charge of electricity. Now a
vector involves direction; and direction is not concerned with what is
merely at that point. It is impossible to define direction without
reference to the rest of space; namely, it involves some relation to the
whole of space.
</p>
<p>
Again the equations involve the spatial differential operators
<img style="vertical-align: -1.034ex; width: 3.673ex; height: 3.07ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\alpha}}">, <img style="vertical-align: -1.11ex; width: 3.542ex; height: 3.145ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\frac {\partial}{\partial y_{\alpha}}">,
<img style="vertical-align: -1.034ex; width: 3.502ex; height: 3.07ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\frac {\partial}{\partial z_{\alpha}}">, which enter through the symbols
<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 13.686ex; height: 1.927ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\text{curl}_{\alpha}\, \text{and}\, \text{div}_{\alpha}">; and
they also involve the temporal differential operator
<img style="vertical-align: -1.034ex; width: 3.335ex; height: 3.07ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\frac{\partial}{\partial t_{\alpha}}">. The
differential coefficients thus produced essentially express properties
in the neighbourhood of the point (<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 9.102ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\alpha}, y_{\alpha}, z_{\alpha}">)
and of the time <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.028ex; height: 1.773ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{\alpha}">, and not merely properties at
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 12.136ex; height: 1.88ex;" src="images/24.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\alpha}, y_{\alpha}, z_{\alpha}, t_{\alpha}">). For a differential
coefficient is a limit, and the limit of a function at a given value of
its argument expresses a property of the aggregate of the values of the
function corresponding to the aggregate of the values of the argument in
the neighbourhood of the given value.
</p>
<p>
This is essentially the same argument as that expressed above in <a href="#art1.2">1.2</a> for
the particular case of motion. Namely, we cannot express the facts of
nature as an aggregate of individual facts at points and at instants.
</p>
<p>
<b>6.2</b> In the Lorentz-Maxwell equations
[cf. <a href="#appen02">Appendix II</a>] there is no
reference to the motion of the ether. The velocity
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 9.658ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="u_{\alpha}, v_{\alpha}, w_{\alpha}">) which
appears in them is the velocity of the electric charge. What then are
the equations of motion of the ether? Before we puzzle over this
question, a preliminary doubt arises. Does the ether move?
</p>
<p>
Certainly, if science is to be based on the data included in the
Lorentz-Maxwell equations, even if the equations be modified, the motion
of the ether does not enter into experience. Accordingly Lorentz assumes
a stagnant ether: that is to say, an ether with no motion,
which is simply the ultimate entity of which the vectors
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 11.64ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/25.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F_{\alpha}, G_{\alpha}, H_{\alpha})"> and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 12.079ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/26.svg" alt=" " data-tex="(L_{\alpha}, M_{\alpha}, N_{\alpha}">)
express properties. Such an ether has certainly a very
shadowy existence; and yet we cannot assume that it moves, merely for
the sake of giving it something to do.
</p>
<p>
<b>6.3</b> The ultimate facts contemplated in Maxwell's equations are the
occurrences of <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 2.381ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/27.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\rho_{\alpha}"> (the volume-density of the charge),
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 9.658ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="u_{\alpha}, v_{\alpha}, w_{\alpha}">),
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 10.76ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="F_{\alpha}, G_{\alpha},H_{\alpha}">) and
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 11.199ex; height: 1.984ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="L_{\alpha}, M_{\alpha}, N_{\alpha}">) at the space-time points in the
neighbourhood surrounding the space-time point
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 12.136ex; height: 1.88ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\alpha}, y_{\alpha},z_{\alpha}, t_{\alpha}">).
But this is merely to say that the ultimate facts
contemplated by Maxwell's equations are certain events which are
occurring throughout all space. The material called ether is merely the
outcome of a metaphysical craving. The continuity of nature is the
continuity of events; and the doctrine of transmission should be
construed as a doctrine of the coextensiveness of events with space and
time and of their reciprocal interaction. In this sense an ether can be
admitted; but, in view of the existing implication of the term,
clearness is gained by a distinction of phraseology. We shall term the
traditional ether an 'ether of material' or a 'material ether,'
and shall employ the term 'ether of events' to express the
assumption of this enquiry, which may be loosely stated as being 'that
something is going on everywhere and always.' It is our purpose to
express accurately the relations between these events so far as they are
disclosed by our perceptual experience, and in particular to consider
those relations from which the essential concepts of Time, Space, and
persistent material are derived. Thus primarily we must not conceive of
events as in a given Time, a given Space, and consisting of changes in
given persistent material. Time, Space, and Material are adjuncts of
events. On the old theory of relativity, Time and Space are relations
between materials; on our theory they are relations between events.

together constitute what is called a 'stress between <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.138ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/32.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.138ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/32.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p">'.
</p>
<p>
Thus the third law of motion falls into three parts, symbolised by the
three sets of equations (2), (3) and (4). The set (2) expresses that all
force on matter is due to stresses between it and other matter; and sets
(3) and (4) express the two fundamental characteristics of stresses. We
need not stop to enquire whether the short verbal expression of the law
logically expresses these three properties. This is a minor point of
exposition dependent on the context in which this formulation of the law
is found.

MAXWELL'S EQUATIONS</h2>

<p>
It will be convenient to state these equations in the slightly
modified form which is due to Lorentz. Space is referred to
the fixed rectangular axis system <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, as in <a href="#art6.1">subarticle 6.1</a>. It will
be necessary to explain a few small points of nomenclature mid

</p>
<p>
A vector is a directed physical quantity; for example, the electric
force at <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> point is a vector. This example also shows that we
have to conceive vectors which have analogous significations at
different points of space. Such a vector is the electric force which may
have a distinct magnitude and direction at each point of space, but
expresses at all points one definite physical fact. Such a vector will
be a function of its position, that is to say, of the coordinates of the
point (<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 9.102ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\alpha}, y_{\alpha}, z_{\alpha}">) of which it is that

<br>
SCIENTIFIC RELATIVITY</h2>

<p>
<a id="art07"><b><i>7. Consentient Sets</i></b></a>. <b>7.1</b> A
traveller in a railway carriage sees a fixed point of the carriage. The
wayside stationmaster knows that the traveller has been in fact
observing a track of points reaching from London to Manchester. The
stationmaster notes his station as fixed in the earth. A being in the
sun conceives the station as exhibiting a track in space round the sun,
and the railway carriage as marking out yet another track. Thus if space
be nothing but relations between material bodies, points as simple
entities disappear. For a point according to one type of observation is
a track of points according to another type. Galileo and the Inquisition
are only in error in the single affirmation in which they both agreed,
namely that absolute position is a physical fact&mdash;the sun for
Galileo and the earth for the Inquisition.
</p>
<p>
<b>7.2</b> Thus each rigid body defines its own space, with its own
points, its own lines, and its own surfaces. Two bodies may agree in
their spaces; namely, what is a point for either may be a point for
both. Also if a third body agrees with either, it will agree with both.
The complete set of bodies, actual or hypothetical, which agree in their
space-formation will be called a 'consentient' set.
</p>
<p>
The relation of a 'dissentient' body to the space of a consentient set
is that of motion through it. The dissentient body will itself belong to
another consentient set. Every body of this second set will have a
motion in the space of the first set which has the same general spatial
characteristics as every other body of the second consentient set;
namely (in technical language) it will at any instant be a screw motion
with the same axis, the same pitch and the same intensity&mdash;in short
the same screw-motion for all bodies of the second set. Thus we will
speak of the motion of one consentient set in the space of another
consentient set. For example such a motion may be translation without
rotation, and the translation may be uniform or accelerated.
</p>
<p>
<b>7.3</b> Now observers in both consentient sets agree as to what is
happening. From different standpoints in nature they both live through
the same events, which in their entirety are all that there is in
nature. The traveller and the stationmaster both agree as to the
existence of a certain event&mdash;for the traveller it is the passage
of the station past the train, and for the stationmaster it is the
passage of the train past the station. The two sets of observers merely
diverge in setting the same events in different frameworks of space and
(according to the modern doctrine) also of time.
</p>
<p>
This spatio-temporal framework is not an arbitrary convention.
Classification is merely an indication of characteristics which are
already there. For example, botanical classification by stamens and
pistils and petals applies to flowers, but not to men. Thus the space of
the consentient set is a fact of nature; the traveller with the set only
discovers it.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art08"><b><i>8. Kinematic Relations</i></b></a>. <b>8.1</b> The
theory of relative motion is the comparison of the motion of a
consentient set <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> in the space of a consentient set
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> with the motion of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> in the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">. This
involves a preliminary comparison of the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> with the space
of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">. Such a comparison can only be made by reference to events
which are facts common to all observers, thus showing the fundamental
character of events in the formation of space and time. The ideally
simple event is one indefinitely restricted both in spatial and in
temporal extension, namely the instantaneous point. We will use the term
'event-particle' in the sense of 'instantaneous point-event.' The exact
meaning of the ideal restriction in extension of an event-particle will
be investigated in <a href="#part03">Part III</a>; here we will assume
that the concept has a determinate signification.
</p>
<p>
<b>8.2</b> An event-particle occupies instantaneously a certain point in
the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and a certain point in the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">.
Thus instantaneously there is a certain correlation between the points
of the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and the points of the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">.
Also if the particle has the character of material at rest at the point
in the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, this material-particle has a certain
velocity in the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">; and if it be material at rest at the
point in the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">, the material-particle has a certain
velocity in the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">. The direction in <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space of
the velocity due to rest in the correlated <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-point is said to
be opposite to the direction in <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space of the velocity due to
rest in the correlated <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-point. Also with congruent units of
space and of time, the measures of the velocities are numerically equal.
The consequences of these fundamental facts are investigated in
<a href="#part03">Part III</a>. The relation of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space to the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space which is expressed by the velocities at points in
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space due to rest in the points of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space and by the

<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space is called the 'kinematic relation' between the two
consentient sets, or between the two spaces.


</p>
<p>
<b>8.3</b> The simplest form of this kinematic relation between a pair
of consentient sets is when the motion of either set in the space of the
other is a uniform translation without acceleration and without
rotation. Such a kinematic relation will be called 'simple.' If a
consentient group <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> has a simple kinematic relation to each of
two consentient sets, <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.229ex; height: 1.486ex;" src="images/74.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma">, then <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.229ex; height: 1.486ex;" src="images/74.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma"> have a simple kinematic relation to each other. In technical
logical language a simple kinematic relation is symmetrical and
transitive.
</p>
<p>
The whole group of consentient sets with simple kinematic relations to
any one consentient set, including that set itself, is called a 'simple'
group of consentient sets.
</p>
<p>
The kinematic relation is called 'translatory' when the relative motion
does not involve rotation; namely, it is a translation but not
necessarily uniform.
</p>
<p>
<b>8.4</b> The fact that the relational theory of space involves that
each consentient set has its own space with its own peculiar points is
ignored in the traditional presentation of physical science. The reason
is that the absolute theory of space is not really abandoned, and the
relative motion, which is all that can be observed, is treated as the
differential effect of two absolute motions.
</p>
<p>
<b>8.5</b> In the enunciation of Newton's Laws of Motion, the velocities
and accelerations of particles must be supposed to refer to the space of
some given consentient set. Evidently the acceleration of a particle is
the same in all the spaces of a simple group of consentient
sets&mdash;at least this has hitherto been the unquestioned assumption.
Recently this assumption has been questioned and does not hold in the
new theory of relativity. Its axiomatic obviousness only arises from the
covert assumption of absolute space. In the new theory Newton's
equations themselves require some slight modification which need not be
considered at this stage of the discussion.
</p>
<p>
In either form, their traditional form or their modified form, Newton's
equations single out one and only one simple group of consentient sets,
and require that the motions of matter be referred to the space of any
one of these sets. If the proper group be chosen the third law of action
and reaction holds. But if the laws hold for one simple group, they
cannot hold for any other such group. For the apparent forces on
particles cannot then be analysed into reciprocal stresses in the space
of any set not a member of the original simple group.
</p>
<p>
Let the simple group for which the laws do hold be called the
'Newtonian' group.
</p>
<p>
<b>8.6</b> Then, for example, if a consentient set <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> have a
non-uniform translatory kinematic relation to members of the Newtonian
group, the particles of the material universe would, when their motions
are referred to the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space, appear to be acted on by forces
parallel to a fixed direction, in the same sense along that direction,
and proportional to the mass of the particle acted on. Such an
assemblage of forces cannot be expressed as an assemblage of reciprocal
stresses between particles. Again if a consentient set <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> have a
non-translatory kinematic relation to the members of the Newtonian
group, then, when motion is referred to the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space,
'centrifugal' and 'composite centrifugal' forces on particles make their
appearance; and these forces cannot be reduced to stresses.
</p>
<p>
<b>8.7</b> The physical consequences of this result are best seen by
taking a particular case. The earth is rotating and its parts are held
together by their mutual gravitational attractions. The result is that
the figure bulges at the equator; and, after allowing for the
deficiencies of our observational knowledge, the results of theory and
experiment are in fair agreement.
</p>
<p>
The dynamical theory of this investigation does not depend on the
existence of any material body other than the earth. Suppose that the
rest of the material universe were annihilated, or at least any part of
it which is visible to our eye-sight. Why not? For after all there is a
very small volume of visible matter compared to the amount of space
available for it. So there is no reason to assume anything very
essential in the existence of a few planets and a few thousand stars. We
are left with the earth rotating. But rotating relatively to what? For
on the relational theory it would seem to be the mutual relations of the
earth's parts which constitute space. And yet the dynamical theory of
the bulge does not refer to any body other than the earth, and so is not
affected by the catastrophe of annihilation. It has been asserted that
after all the fixed stars are essential, and that it is the rotation
relatively to them which produces the bulge. But surely this ascription
of the centrifugal force on the earth's surface to the influence of
Sirius is the last refuge of a theory in distress. The point is that the
physical properties, size, and distance of Sirius do not seem to matter.
The more natural deduction (on the theory of Newtonian relativity) is to
look on the result as evidence that the theory of any empty space is an
essential impossibility. Accordingly the absoluteness of direction is
evidence for the existence of the material ether. This result only
reinforces a conclusion which has already been reached on other grounds.
Thus space expresses mutual relations of the parts of the ether, as well
as of the parts of the earth.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art09"><b><i>9. Motion through the Ether</i></b></a>. <b>9.1</b>
The existence of the material ether should discriminate between the
consentient sets of the Newtonian group. For one such set will be at
rest relatively to the ether, and the remaining sets will be moving
through it with definite velocities. It becomes a problem to discover
phenomena dependent on such velocities.
</p>
<p>
Can any phenomena be detected which are unequivocally due to a
quasi-absolute motion of the earth through the ether? For this purpose
we must put aside phenomena which depend on the differential velocities
of two bodies of matter, e.g. the earth and a planet, or a star. For
such phenomena are evidently primarily due to the relative velocity of
the two bodies to each other, and the velocities relatively to the ether
only arise as a hypothetical intermediate explanatory analysis. We
require phenomena concerned solely with the earth, which are modified by
the earth's motion through the ether without reference to any other
matter. We have already concluded that the bulging of the earth at the
equator is one such required instance, unless indeed (with Newton) we
assume absolute space.
</p>
<p>
<b>9.2</b> The effects on the observed light due to the relative motions
of the emitting body and the receiving body are various and depend in
part on the specific nature of the assumed disturbances which constitute
light. Some of these effects have been observed, for example, aberration
and the effect on the spectrum due to the motion of the emitting body in
the line of sight. Aberration is the apparent change in the direction of
the luminous body due to the motion of the receiving body. The motion of
the luminous body in the line of sight should alter the wave length of
the emitted light due to molecular vibrations of given periodicity. In
other words, it should alter the quality of the light due to such
vibrations. These are the effects which have been observed, but they are
of the type which we put aside as not relevant to our purpose owing to
the fact that the observed effect ultimately depends merely on the
relative motion of the emitting and receiving bodies.
</p>
<p>
<b>9.3</b> There are effects on interference fringes which we should
expect to be due to the motion of the earth. In six months the velocity
of the earth in its orbit is reversed. So that such effects as the
earth's motion produces in the interference fringes of a certain purely
terrestrial apparatus at one time can be compared with the corresponding
effects in the same apparatus which it produces after the lapse of six
months and&mdash;as the experiments have been carried out&mdash;the
differences should have been easily discernible. No such differences
have been observed. The effects, which are thus sought for, depend on no
special theory of the nature of the luminous disturbance in the ether.
They should result from the simple fact of the wave disturbance, and the
magnitude of its velocity relatively to the apparatus.
</p>
<p>
It will be observed that the difficulty which arises from the absence of
this predicted effect does not discriminate in any way between the
philosophic theories of absolute or of relative space. The effect should
arise from the motion of the earth relatively to the ether, and there is
such relative motion whichever of the alternative spatial theories be
adopted.
</p>
<p>
<b>9.4</b> Electromagnetic phenomena are also implicated in the theory
of relative motion. Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic field
hold in respect to these phenomena an analogous position to that
occupied by Newton's equations of motion for the explanation of the
motion of matter. They differ from Newton's equations very essentially
in their relation to the principle of relativity. Newton's equations
single out no special member of the Newtonian group to which they
specially apply. They are invariant for the spatio-temporal
transformations from one such set to another within the Newtonian group.
</p>
<p>
But Maxwell's electromagnetic equations are not thus invariant for the
Newtonian group. The result is that they must be construed as referring
to one particular consentient set of this group. It is natural to
suppose that this particular assumption arises from the fact that the
equations refer to the physical properties of a stagnant ether; and that
accordingly the consentient set presupposed in the equations is the
consentient set of this ether. The ether is identified with the ether
whose wave disturbances constitute light; and furthermore there are
practically conclusive reasons for believing light to be merely
electromagnetic disturbances which are governed by Maxwell's equations.
</p>
<p>
The motion of the earth through the ether affects other electromagnetic
phenomena in addition to those known to us as light. Such effects, as
also in the case of light, would be very small and difficult to observe.
But the effect on the capacity of a condenser of the six-monthly
reversal of the earth's velocity should under proper conditions be
observable. This is known as Trouton's experiment. Again, as in the
analogous case of light, no such effect has been observed.
</p>
<p>
<b>9.5</b> The explanation [the Fitzgerald-Lorentz hypothesis] of these
failures to observe expected effects has been given, that matter as it
moves through ether automatically readjusts its shape so that its
lengths in the direction of motion are altered in a definite ratio
dependent on its velocity. The null results of the experiments are thus
completely accounted for, and the material ether evades the most obvious
method of testing its existence. If matter is thus strained by its
passage through ether, some effect on its optical properties due to the
strains might be anticipated. Such effects have been sought for, but not
observed. Accordingly with the assumption of an ether of material the
negative results of the various experiments are explained by an <i>ad
hoc</i> hypothesis which appears to be related to no other phenomena in
nature.
</p>
<p>
<b>9.6</b> There is another way in which the motion of matter may be
balanced (so to speak) against the velocity of light. Fizeau
experimented on the passage of light through translucent moving matter,
and obtained results which Fresnel accounted for by multiplying the
refractive index of the moving medium by a coefficient dependent on its
velocity. This is Fresnel's famous 'coefficient of drag.' He accounted
for this coefficient by assuming that as the material medium in its
advance sucks in the ether, it condenses it in a proportion dependent on
the velocity. It might be expected that any theory of the relations of
matter to ether, either an ether of material or an ether of events,
would explain also this coefficient of drag.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art10"><b><i>10. Formulae for Relative Motion</i></b></a>.
<b>10.1</b> In transforming the equations of motion from the space of
one member of the Newtonian group to the space of another member of that
group, it must be remembered that the facts which are common to the two
standpoints are the events, and that the ideally simple analysis
exhibits events as dissected into collections of event-particles. Thus
if <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> be the two consentient sets, the points of
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space are distinct from the points of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space,
but the same event-particle <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> is at the point <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.664ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/76.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\alpha}">
at the time <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.533ex; height: 1.889ex;" src="images/77.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T_{\alpha}"> in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space and is at the
point <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.546ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/78.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\beta}"> at the time <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.415ex; height: 2.181ex;" src="images/79.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T_{\beta}"> in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space.
</p>
<p>
With the covert assumption of absolute space which is habitual in the
traditional outlook, it is tacitly assumed that <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.664ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/76.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\alpha}"> and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.546ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/78.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\beta}"> are the same point and that there is a common time and
common measurement of time which are the same for all consentient sets.
The first assumption is evidently very badly founded and cannot easily
be reconciled to the nominal scientific creed; the second assumption
seems to embody a deeply rooted experience. The corresponding formulae
of transformation which connect the measurements of space, velocity, and
acceleration in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-system for space and time with the
corresponding measurements in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-system certainly are those
suggested by common sense and in their results they agree very closely
with the result of careful observation. These formulae are the ordinary
formulae of dynamical treatises. For such transformations the Newtonian
equations are invariant within the Newtonian group.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.2</b> But, as we have seen, this invariance, with these formulae
for transformation, does not extend to Maxwell's equations for the
electromagnetic field. The conclusion is that&mdash;still assuming these
formulae for transformation&mdash;Maxwell's equations apply to the
electromagnetic field as referred to one particular consentient set of
the Newtonian group. It is natural to suppose that this set should be
that one with respect to which the stagnant ether is at rest. Namely,
stating the same fact conversely, the stagnant ether defines this
consentient set. There would be no difficulty about this conclusion
except for the speculative character of the material ether, and the
failure to detect the evidences of the earth's motion through it. This
consentient set defined by the ether would for all practical purposes
define absolute space.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.3</b> There are however other formulae of transformation from the
space and time measurements of set <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> to the space and time
measurements of set <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> for which Maxwell's equations are
invariant. These formulae were discovered first by Larmor for uncharged
regions of the field and later by Lorentz for the general case of
regions charged or uncharged. Larmor and Lorentz treated their discovery
from its formal mathematical side. This aspect of it is important. It
enables us, when we thoroughly understand the sequence of events in one
electromagnetic field, to deduce innumerable other electromagnetic
fields which will be understood equally well. All mathematicians will
appreciate what an advance in knowledge this constitutes.
</p>
<p>
But Lorentz also pointed out that if these formulae for transformation
could be looked on as the true formulae for transformation from one set
to another of the Newtonian group, then all the unsuccessful experiments
to detect the earth's motion through the ether could be explained.
Namely, the results of the experiments are such as theory would predict.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.4</b> The general reason for this conclusion was given by Einstein
in a theorem of the highest importance. He proved that the Lorentzian
formulae of transformation from one consentient set to another of the
Newtonian group&mdash;from set <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> to set <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">&mdash;are the
necessary and sufficient conditions that motion with the one particular
velocity <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> (the velocity of light <i>in vacuo</i>) in one of the
sets, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> or <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">, should also appear as motion with the
same magnitude <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> in the other set, <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> or <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">. The
phenomena of aberration will be preserved owing to the relation between
the directions of the velocity expressing the movements in
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space respectively. This preservation of
the magnitude of a special velocity (however directed) cannot arise with
the traditional formulae for relativity. It practically means that waves
or other influences advancing with velocity <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> as referred to the
space of any consentient set of the Newtonian group will also advance
with the same velocity c as referred to the space of any other such set.
</p>
<p>
<b>10.5</b> At first sight the two formulae for transformation, namely
the traditional formulae and the Lorentzian formulae, appear to be very
different. We notice however that, if <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> be the
two consentient sets and if <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.436ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/80.svg" alt=" " data-tex="V_{\alpha\beta}"> be the velocity of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space and of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> in the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space, the differences between the two formulae all depend
upon the square of the ratio of <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.436ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/80.svg" alt=" " data-tex="V_{\alpha\beta}"> to <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c">, where
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> is the velocity of light <i>in vacuo</i>, and are negligible in
proportion to the smallness of this number. For ordinary motions, even
planetary motions, this ratio is extremely small and its square is
smaller still. Accordingly the differences between the two formulae
would not be perceptible under ordinary circumstances. In fact the
effect of the difference would only be perceived in those experiments,
already discussed, whose results have been in entire agreement with the
Lorentzian formulae.
</p>
<p>
The conclusion at once evokes the suggestion that the Lorentzian
formulae are the true formulae for transformation from the space and
time relations of a consentient set <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> to those of a consentient
set <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">, both sets belonging to the Newtonian group. We may
suppose that, owing to bluntness of perception, mankind has remained
satisfied with the Newtonian formulae which are a simplified version of
the true Lorentzian relations. This is the conclusion that Einstein has
urged.

<p>
<b>10.6</b> These Lorentzian formulae for transformation involve two
consequences which are paradoxical if we covertly assume absolute space
and absolute time. Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> be two consentient sets
of the Newtonian group. Let an event-particle <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> happen at the point
<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.664ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/76.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\alpha}"> in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space and at the point <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.546ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/78.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\beta}"> in
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space, and let another event-particle <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.79ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q"> happen at
points <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 3.001ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/81.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q_{\alpha}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.883ex; height: 2.242ex;" src="images/82.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q_{\beta}"> in the two spaces respectively.
Then according to the traditional scientific outlook, <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.664ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/76.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\alpha}"> and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.546ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/78.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\beta}"> are not discriminated from each other; and similarly for
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 3.001ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/81.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q_{\alpha}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.883ex; height: 2.242ex;" src="images/82.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q_{\beta}">. Thus evidently the distance
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 5.665ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/83.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\alpha}Q_{\alpha}"> is (on this theory) equal to
<img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 5.429ex; height: 2.242ex;" src="images/84.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\beta}Q_{\beta}">, because in fact they are symbols for the same
distance. But if the true distinction between the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space and
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space is kept in mind, including the fact that the points
in the two spaces are radically distinct, the equality of the distances
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 5.665ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/83.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\alpha}Q_{\alpha}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 5.429ex; height: 2.242ex;" src="images/84.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\beta}Q_{\beta}"> is not so obvious.
According to the Lorentzian formulae such corresponding distances in the
two spaces will not in general be equal.
</p>
<p>
The second consequence of the Lorentzian formulae involves a more deeply
rooted paradox which concerns our notions of time. If the two
event-particles <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.79ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q"> happen simultaneously when referred to

they will in general not happen simultaneously when referred to the
points <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.546ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/78.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{\beta}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.883ex; height: 2.242ex;" src="images/82.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q_{\beta}"> in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space. This
result of the Lorentzian formulae contradicts the assumption of one
absolute time, and makes the time-system depend on the consentient set
which is adopted as the standard of reference. Thus there is an
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-time as well as an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space, and a <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-time as
well as <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space.

<b>10.7</b> The explanation of the similarities and differences between
spaces and times derived from different consentient sets of the
Newtonian group, and of the fact of there being a Newtonian group at
all, will be derived in <a href="#part02">Parts II</a> and
<a href="#part03">III</a> of this enquiry from a consideration of the
general characteristics of our perceptive knowledge of nature, which is
our whole knowledge of nature. In seeking such an explanation one
principle may be laid down. Time and space are among the fundamental
physical facts yielded by our knowledge of the external world. We cannot
rest content with any theory of them which simply takes mathematical
equations involving four variables (<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 7.29ex; height: 1.88ex;" src="images/85.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x, y, z, t">) and interprets (<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 5.467ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/86.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x,

the ground that some physical law is thereby expressed. This is not an
interpretation of what we mean by space and time. What we mean are
physical facts expressible in terms of immediate perceptions; and it is
incumbent on us to produce the perceptions of those facts as the
meanings of our terms.

First consider the traditional theory of relativity. Then the

These are the 'Newtonian' formulae for relative motion.
</p>
<p>
Secondly consider the Lorentzian [or 'electromagnetic'] theory of
relativity. The two time-systems for reference to <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and for
reference to <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> respectively are not identical. Let
<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.028ex; height: 1.773ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{\alpha}"> be the measure of the lapse of time in the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-system, and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 1.91ex; height: 2.066ex;" src="images/101.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{\beta}"> be the measure of the lapse of time
in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-system. The distinction between the two time-systems is
embodied in the fact that event-particles which happen simultaneously at
time <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.028ex; height: 1.773ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{\alpha}"> in <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space do not happen simultaneously
throughout space <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">. Thus supposing that an event-particle
happens at (<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 12.136ex; height: 1.88ex;" src="images/24.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\alpha}, y_{\alpha}, z_{\alpha}, t_{\alpha}">) in
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-time and at
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 11.663ex; height: 2.066ex;" src="images/102.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x_{\beta}, y_{\beta}, z_{\beta}, t_{\beta}">) in
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-space and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-time, we seek for the formulae
which are to replace equations (1) of the Newtonian theory.
</p>
<p>
As before let <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 6.023ex; height: 1.95ex;" src="images/93.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{\alpha}X_{\alpha}"> lie in the direction of the
motion of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> in <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.955ex; width: 6.408ex; height: 2.673ex;" src="images/103.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{\beta}^{\prime}X_{\beta}{\prime}"> in the reverse direction of the
motion of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> in <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">. Also let <img style="vertical-align: -0.576ex; width: 2.938ex; height: 2.294ex;" src="images/92.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{\alpha}^{\prime}"> lie
on <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 6.023ex; height: 1.95ex;" src="images/93.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{\alpha}X_{\alpha}">, so that event-particles which happen on
<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 6.023ex; height: 1.95ex;" src="images/93.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{\alpha}X_{\alpha}"> also happen, on

time-systems is secured by the rule that event-particles which happen
simultaneously at points in <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-space on a plane perpendicular to

quasi-parallelism of <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 5.464ex; height: 1.95ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{\alpha}Y_{\alpha}"> to

the same way as for Newtonian relativity.

The same meaning as above will be given to <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.436ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/80.svg" alt=" " data-tex="V_{\alpha\beta}"> and

CONGRUENCE</h2>

<a id="art11"><b><i>11. Simultaneity</i></b></a>. <b>11.1</b> Einstein
analysed the ideas of time-order and of simultaneity. Primarily
(according to his analysis) time-order only refers to the succession of
events at a given place. Accordingly each given place has its own
time-order. But these time-orders are not independent in the system of
nature, and their correlation is known to us by means of physical
measurements. Now ultimately all physical measurement depends upon
coincidence in time and place. If <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> be two places,
the time-orders <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.714ex; height: 1.932ex;" src="images/128.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.714ex; height: 1.932ex;" src="images/129.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{2}"> which belong to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> are correlated by observations of coincidences at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">
and at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> respectively.
</p>
<p>
Thus, confining ourselves to the two places <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}">,
there are two distinct processes of correlating the time-order of events
throughout the universe, namely by a series of observations of
coincidences at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> based on time-order <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.714ex; height: 1.932ex;" src="images/128.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{1}"> and by a series
of observations of coincidences at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> based on time-order
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.714ex; height: 1.932ex;" src="images/129.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{2}">. These two processes are distinct and will only agree by some
accident of special circumstance.
</p>
<p>
<b>11.2</b> What are the observations at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> which will assign to
an event at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> a position in the time-order <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.714ex; height: 1.932ex;" src="images/128.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{1}">? Suppose
some message&mdash;a wave disturbance, for example&mdash;starts from
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> when event <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/130.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{1}"> happens at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">, reaches <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}">
when event <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/131.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{2}"> happens at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> and is immediately reflected
so as to return to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> when event <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/130.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{1}">″ happens
at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">. Now according to the method of time-measurement for
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.714ex; height: 1.932ex;" src="images/128.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{1}">, there is an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/130.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{1}">′ which happens at mid-time
between <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/130.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/130.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{1}">″. Then, when certain
conditions have been fulfilled, the event <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/131.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{2}"> at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> is
defined as simultaneous with the event <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/130.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{1}">′ at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> according
to the method of correlation appropriate to place <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">. In this way
a time-order of events at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> is derived solely from observation
of coincidence at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> and is based solely on the fundamental
time-order <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.714ex; height: 1.932ex;" src="images/128.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{1}"> at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">. Thus the time-order at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> is
extended as a time-order for all events at all places.
</p>
<p>
<b>11.3</b> There are questions which require elucidation before this
definition can be understood. What is a place? We have chosen a vague
term on purpose, so as to postpone its consideration until now. A place
can only be marked by phenomena capable of recognition, for example the
continued appearance of a material body. Thus we must construe <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> to be the names of material bodies, or of persistent sets
of circumstances which will serve the same purpose. In general <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> will be in relative motion with respect to each other.
</p>
<p>
What of the message which passes from <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> and back to
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">? Its transmission must be uniform. Suppose the message travels
with velocity <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c">, that is, with the velocity of light <i>in
vacuo</i>. Then, assuming the electromagnetic formulae for relativity,
this velocity relative to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> is independent (so far as its
magnitude is concerned) of the velocity which we ascribe to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">
through space.
</p>
<p>
<b>11.4</b> Thus our recording body <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> can be any body at rest in
some consentient set of the Newtonian group, and we reckon motion as
relative to the space of this set. We send our message with the velocity
of light <i>in vacuo</i>. Then, according to the local time-order
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.714ex; height: 1.932ex;" src="images/128.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{1}"> at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">, the event <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/131.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{2}"> at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/127.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{2}"> is simultaneous
with the event <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/130.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{1}">′ at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">. This definition of simultaneity
in the local time-order at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> is independent of any assumption of
absolute rest for <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> provided that the electromagnetic formulae
for relativity are adopted. The local time-order at <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}"> is also in
complete agreement with the local time-order at any body <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 2.777ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/132.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q_{1}"> which
is rigidly connected with <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">, i.e. which belongs to the same
consentient set.
</p>
<p>
<b>11.5</b> The reason why the velocity of light has been adopted as the
standard velocity in the definition of simultaneity is because the
negative results of the experiments to determine the earth's motion
require that this velocity, which is the '<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c">' of Maxwell's equations,
should have this property. Also light signals are after all our only way
of detecting distant events.
</p>
<p>
Certainly, once granting the idea of time-order being a local affair
connected with a specific body <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.44ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/126.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P_{1}">, the acceptance of the
electromagnetic formula connecting <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.028ex; height: 1.773ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{\alpha}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 1.91ex; height: 2.066ex;" src="images/101.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t_{\beta}"> is a
slight affair. There is no presumption against it, once granting the
conception of diverse time-orders which had not hitherto been thought
of.
</p>
<p>
<b>11.6</b> But there are certain objections to the acceptance of
Einstein's definition of simultaneity, the 'signal-theory' as we will
call it. In the first place light signals are very important elements in
our lives, but still we cannot but feel that the signal-theory somewhat
exaggerates their position. The very meaning of simultaneity is made to
depend on them. There are blind people and dark cloudy nights, and
neither blind people nor people in the dark are deficient in a sense of
simultaneity. They know quite well what it means to bark both their
shins at the same instant. In fact the determination of simultaneity in
this way is never made, and if it could be made would not be accurate;
for we live in air and not <i>in vacuo</i>.
</p>
<p>
Also there are other physical messages from place to place; there is the
transmission of material bodies, the transmission of sound, the
transmission of waves and ripples on the surface of water, the
transmission of nerve excitation through the body, and innumerable other
forms which enter into habitual experience. The transmission of light is
only one form among many.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore local time does not concern one material particle only. The
same definition of simultaneity holds throughout the whole space of a
consentient set in the Newtonian group. The message theory does not
account for the consentience in time-reckoning which characterises a
consentient set, nor does it account for the fundamental position of the
Newtonian group.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art12"><b><i>12. Congruence and Recognition</i></b></a>.
<b>12.1</b> Again the theory that measurement is essentially coincidence
requires severe qualification. For if it were true only coincident
things, coincident both in time and space, could be equal, yet
measurement can only be of the slightest importance in so far as some
other element not coincidence enters into it.
</p>
<p>
Let us take a simple example. Two footrules are placed together and are
found to coincide. Then at the moment of coincidence they are equal in
length. But what is the use of that information? We want to use one rule
to-morrow in London and the other rule a week hence in Manchester, and
to know that the stuffs which they measure are of equal length. Now we
know that, provided they are made of certain sorts of material (luckily,
materials easy to procure) and treated with certain precautions
(luckily, precautions easy to observe), the footrules will not have
altered their lengths to any extent which can be detected. But that
means a direct judgment of constancy. Without such a judgment in some
form or other, measurement becomes trivial.
</p>
<p>
<b>12.2</b> It may be objected that whenever the footrules are brought
together, or when stuffs measured by them are brought together, the
coincidences will be observed; and that this is all we need for the
importance of measurement.
</p>
<p>
But the coincidences will not be observed unless the circumstances of
the various experiments are sufficiently uniform. The stuffs must be
under the same tension or at the same temperatures as on previous
occasions. Sooner or later and somehow or other a judgment of constancy,
that is, of the preservation of property, is required. Ultimately this
judgment reposes upon direct common sense; namely, obviously the
footrule is of good stiff material and has not perceptibly changed amid
slight differences of circumstance. The coincidences which can easily be
obtained between lengths of elastic thread inspire no such beliefs,
because evidently the thread has been stretched.
</p>
<p>
<b>12.3</b> Again, in Einstein's own example, there is the direct
judgment of the uniformity of conditions for the uniform transmission of
light. Thus any ordinary event among the fixed stars does not affect
this uniformity for the transmission from the sun to the earth. Apart
from such presuppositions, so obvious that they do not enter into
consciousness, the whole theory collapses.
</p>
<p>
<b>12.4</b> These judgments of constancy are based on an immediate
comparison of circumstances at different times and at different places.
Such judgments are not infallible and are capable of being tested under
certain circumstances. For example it may be judged that two footrules
would coincide if they were brought together; and this experiment can be
made, and the judgment tested.
</p>
<p>
The rejection of an immediate judgment of constancy is no paradox. There
are differences between any distinct sets of circumstances, and it is
always possible that these differences cut deeper than we have perceived
so as to produce unsuspected divergences of properties.
</p>
<p>
But a judgment of constancy is recognition, and recognition is the
source of all our natural knowledge. Accordingly though isolated
judgments may be rejected, it is essential that a rational consideration
of nature should assume the truth of the greater part of such judgments
and should issue in theories which embody them.
</p>
<p>
<b>12.5</b> This recognition of congruity between distinct circumstances
has no especial connection with coincidence and extends far beyond the
mere judgments of time and space. Thus judgments of the matching of
colours can be made without coincidence by most people to some slight
extent, and by some people with surprising accuracy. It may be urged
that only in the case of judgments of spatial and temporal coincidence
can great accuracy be obtained. This may be true; but complete accuracy
is never obtained, and the ideal of accuracy shows that the meaning is
not derived from the measurement. Our recognitions are the ultimate
facts of nature for science, and the whole scientific theory is nothing
else than an attempt to systematise our knowledge of the circumstances
in which such recognitions will occur. The theory of congruence is one
branch of the more general theory of recognitions. Another branch is the
theory of objects which is considered in the next part of this enquiry.

THE NATURAL ELEMENTS</h2>

<p>
<a id="art13"><b><i>13. The Diversification of Nature</i></b></a>.
<b>13.1</b> Our perceptual knowledge of nature consists in the breaking
up of a whole which is the subject matter of perceptual experience, or
is the given presentation which is experience&mdash;or however else we
prefer to describe the ultimate experienced fact. This whole is
discriminated as being a complex of related entities, each entity having
determinate qualities and relations and being a subject concerning which
our perceptions, either directly of indirectly, afford definite
information. This process of breaking up the subject matter of
experience into a complex of entities will be called the
'diversification of nature.'
</p>
<p>
<b><a id="art13.2">13.2</a></b> This diversification of nature is
performed in different ways, according to different procedures which
yield different analyses of nature into component entities. It is not
merely that one mode of diversification of nature is incomplete and
leaves out some entities which another mode supplies. The entities which
are yielded by different modes of diversification are radically
different; and it is the neglect of this distinction between the
entities of complexes produced by different modes of diversification
which has produced so much confusion in the principles of natural
knowledge.
</p>
<p>
There are an indefinite number of types of entity disclosed in this
diversification. An attempt in this enquiry to trace the subtlety of
nature would only blur the main argument. Accordingly we confine
attention to five modes of diversification which are chiefly important
in scientific theory. These types of entities are: (i) events, (ii)
percipient objects, (iii) sense-objects, (iv) perceptual objects, (v)
scientific objects. These are five radically distinct types of entities
yielded by five distinct procedures; and their only common quality as
entities is that they are all alike subjects yielded for our knowledge
by our perceptions of nature.
</p>
<p>
<b>13.3</b> The entities which are the product of any one mode of
diversification of nature will be called elements, or aspects, of
nature; each such entity is one natural element. Thus each mode of
diversification produces natural elements of a type peculiar to itself.
</p>
<p>
One mode of diversification is not necessarily more abstract than
another. Objects can be looked on as qualities of events, and events as
relations between objects, or&mdash;more usefully&mdash;we can drop the
metaphysical and difficult notion of inherent qualities and consider the
elements of different types as bearing to each other relations.
</p>
<p>
There are accordingly two main genera of relations to be distinguished,
namely 'homogeneous' relations which relate among themselves natural
elements of the same type, and 'heterogeneous' relations which relate
natural elements of different types.
</p>
<p>
<b>13.4</b> Another way of considering the diversification of nature is
to emphasise primarily the relations between natural elements. Thus
those elements are what is perceived in nature as thus related. In other
words the relations are treated as fundamental and the natural elements
are introduced as in their capacity of relata. But of course this is
merely another mode of expression, since relations and relata imply each
other.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art14"><b><i>14. Events</i></b></a>.
<b><a id="art14.1">14.1</a></b> Events are the relata of the fundamental
homogeneous relation of 'extension.' Every event extends over other
events which are parts of itself, and every event is extended over by
other events of which it is part. The externality of nature is the
outcome of this relation of extension. Two events are mutually external,
or are 'separate,' if there is no event which is part of both. Time and
space both spring from the relation of extension. Their derivation will
be considered in detail in subsequent parts of this enquiry. It follows
that time and space express relations between events. Other natural
elements which are not events are only in time and space derivatively,
namely, by reason of their relations to events. Great confusion has been
caused to the philosophy of science by this neglect of the derivative
nature of the spatial and temporal relations of objects of various
types.
</p>
<p>
<b>14.2</b> The relation of extension exhibits events as actual&mdash;as
matters of fact&mdash;by means of its properties which issue in spatial
relations; and it exhibits events as involving the becomingness of
nature&mdash;its passage or creative advance&mdash;by means of its
properties which issue in temporal relations. Thus events are
essentially elements of actuality and elements of becomingness. An
actual event is thus divested of all possibility. It is what does become
in nature. It can never happen again; for essentially it is just itself,
there and then. An event is just what it is, and is just how it is
related and it is nothing else. Any event, however similar, with
different relations is another event. There is no element of hypothesis
in any actual event. There are imaginary events&mdash;or, rather,
imaginations of events&mdash;but there is nothing actual about such
events, except so far as imagination is actual. Time and space, which
are entirely actual and devoid of any tincture of possibility, are to be
sought for among the relations of events.
</p>
<p>
<b>14.3</b> Events never change. Nature develops, in the sense that an
event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> becomes part of an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">′ which includes (i.e. extends
over) <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> and also extends into the futurity beyond <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">. Thus in a
sense the event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> does change, namely, in its relations to the
events which were not and which become actual in the creative advance of
nature. The change of an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">, in this meaning of the term
'change,' will be called the 'passage' of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">; and the word 'change'
will not be used in this sense. Thus we say that events pass but do not
change. The passage of an event is its passing into some other event
which is not it.
</p>
<p>
An event in passing becomes part of larger events; and thus the passage
of events is extension in the making. The terms 'the past,' 'the
present,' and 'the future' refer to events. The irrevocableness of the
past is the unchangeability of events. An event is what it is, when it
is, and where it is. Externality and extension are the marks of events;
an event is there and not here [or, here and not there], it is then and
not now [or, now and not then], it is part of certain wholes and is a
whole extending over certain parts.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art15"><b><i>15. Objects</i></b></a>. <b>15.1</b> Objects enter
into experience by recognition and without recognition experience would
divulge no objects. Objects convey the permanences recognised in events,
and are recognised as self-identical amid different circumstances; that
is to say, the same object is recognised as related to diverse events.
Thus the self-identical object maintains itself amid the flux of events:
it is there and then, and it is here and now; and the 'it' which has its
being there and here, then and now, is without equivocation the same
subject for thought in the various judgments which are made upon it.
</p>
<p>
<b><a id="art15.2">15.2</a></b> The change of an object is the diverse
relationships of the same object to diverse events. The object is
permanent, because (strictly speaking) it is without time and space; and
its change is merely the variety of its relations to the various events
which are passing in time and in space. This passage of events in time
and space is merely the exhibition of the relations of extension which
events bear to each other, combined with the directional factor in time
which expresses that ultimate becomingness which is the creative advance
of nature. These extensional relations of events are analysed in later
parts of this enquiry. But here we merely make clear that change in
objects is no derogation from their permanence, and expresses their
relation to the passage of events; whereas events are neither permanent
nor do they change. Events (in a sense) are space and time, namely,
space and time are abstractions from events. But objects are only
derivatively in space and time by reason of their relations to events.
</p>
<p>
<b>15.3</b> The ways in which events and objects enter into experience
are distinct. Events are lived through, they extend around us. They are
the medium within which our physical experience develops, or, rather,
they are themselves the development of that experience. The facts of
life are the events of life.
</p>
<p>
Objects enter into experience by way of the intellectuality of
recognition. This does not mean that every object must have been known
before; for in that case there never could have been a first knowledge.
We must rid our imagination of the fallacious concept of the present as
instantaneous. It is a duration, or stretch of time; and the primary
recognition of an object consists of the recognition of its permanence
amid the partial events of the duration which is present. Its
recognition is carried beyond the present by means of recollection and
memory.
</p>
<p>
Rational thought which is the comparison of event with event would be
intrinsically impossible without objects.
</p>
<p>
<b><a id="art15.4">15.4</a></b> Objects and events are only waveringly
discriminated in common thought. Whatever is purely matter of fact is an
event. Whenever the concept of possibility can apply to a natural
element, that element is an object. Namely, objects have the possibility
of recurrence in experience: we can conceive imaginary circumstances in
which a real object might occur. The essence of an object does not
depend on its relations, which are external to its being. It has in fact
certain relations to other natural elements; but it might (being the
same object) have had other relations. In other words, its self-identity
is not wholly dependent on its relations. But an event is just what it
is, and is just how it is related; and it is nothing else.
</p>
<p>
Thus objects lack the fixedness of relations which events possess, and
thus time and space could never be a direct expression of their
essential relations. Two objects have (by the mediation of events) all
the mutual space relations which they do have throughout their
existence, and might have many which they do not have. Thus two objects,
being what they are, have no necessary temporal and spatial relations
which are essential to their individualities.
</p>
<p>
<b>15.5</b> The chief confusion between objects and events is conveyed
in the prejudice that an object can only be in one place at a time. That
is a fundamental property of events; and whenever that property appears
axiomatic as holding of some physical entity, that entity is an event.
It must be remembered however that ordinary thought wavers confusedly
between events and objects. It is the misplacement of this axiom from
events to objects which has wrecked the theory of natural objects.
</p>
<p>
<b>15.6</b> It is an error to ascribe parts to objects, where 'part'
here means spatial or temporal part. The erroneousness of such
ascription immediately follows from the premiss that primarily an object
is not in space or in time. The absence of temporal parts of objects is
a commonplace of thought. No one thinks that part of a stone is at one
time and another part of the stone is at another time. The same stone is
at both times, in the sense in which the stone is existing at those
times (if it be existing). But spatial parts are in a different
category, and it is natural to think of various parts of a stone,
simultaneously existing. Such a conception confuses the stone as an
object with the event which exhibits the actual relations of the stone
within nature. It is indeed very natural to ascribe spatial parts to a
stone, for the reason that a stone is an instance of a perceptual
object. These objects are the objects of common life, and it is very
difficult precisely to discern such an object in the events with which
it has its most obvious relations. The struggle to make precise the
concept of these objects either forces us back to the sense-objects or
forward to the scientific objects. The difficulty is chiefly one of
making thought clear. That there is a perception of an object with
self-identity, is shown by the common usage of mankind. Indeed these
perceptual objects forced upon mankind&mdash;and seemingly also on
animals, unless it be those of the lowest type&mdash;their knowledge of
the objectified character of nature. But the confusion of the object,
which is a unity, with the events, which have parts, is always imminent.
In biological organisms the character of the organism as an object is
more clear.
</p>
<p>
<b>15.7</b> The fundamental rule is that events have parts and
that&mdash;except in a derivative sense, from their relations to
events&mdash;objects have no parts. On the other hand the same object
can be found in different parts of space and time, and this cannot hold
for events. Thus the identity of an object may be an important physical
fact, while the identity of an event is essentially a trivial logical
necessity. Thus the prisoner in the dock may be the man who did the
deed. But the deed lies in the irrevocable past; only the allegation of
it is before the court and perhaps (in some countries) a reconstitution
of the crime. Essentially the very deed itself is never there.
</p>
<p>
<b><a id="art15.8">15.8</a></b> The continuity of nature is to be found
in events, the atomic properties of nature reside in objects. The
continuous ether is the whole complex of events; and the atoms and
molecules are scientific objects, which are entities of essentially
different type to the events forming the ether.
</p>
<p>
<b>15.9</b> This contrast in the ways we perceive events and objects
deserves a distinction in nomenclature. Accordingly, for want of better
terms, we shall say that we 'apprehend' an event and 'recognise' an
object. To apprehend an event is to be aware of its passage as happening
in that nature, which we each of us know as though it were common to all
percipients. It is unnecessary for the purposes of science to consider
the difficult metaphysical question of this community of nature to all.
It is sufficient that, for the awareness of each, it is as though it
were common to all, and that science is a body of doctrine true for this
quasi-common nature which is the subject for the experience of each
percipient; namely, science is true for each percipient.
</p>
<p>
To recognise an object is to be aware of it in its specific relations to
definite events in nature. Thus we refer the object to some events as
its 'situations,' we connect it with other events as the locus from
which it is being perceived, and we connect it with other events as
conditions for such perception of it as in such situations from such a
locus of percipience.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly in these (arbitrary) senses of the words we apprehend nature
as continuous and we recognise it as atomic.

<br>
EVENTS</h2>

<p>
<a id="art16"><b><i>16. Apprehension of Events</i></b></a>. <b>16.1</b>
It is the purpose of this chapter to summarise the leading
characteristics of our knowledge of nature as diversified into a complex
of events.
</p>
<p>
Perception is an awareness of events, or happenings, forming a partially
discerned complex within the background of a simultaneous whole of
nature. This awareness is definitely related to one event, or group of
events, within the discerned complex. This event is called the
percipient event. The simultaneity of the whole of nature comprising the
discerned events is the special relation of that background of nature to
the percipient event. This background is that complete event which is
the whole of nature simultaneous with the percipient event, which is
itself part of that whole. Such a complete whole of nature is called a
'duration.' A duration (in the sense in which henceforth the word will
be used) is not an abstract stretch of time, and to that extent the term
'duration' is misleading. In perception the associated duration is
apprehended as an essential element in the awareness, but it is not
discriminated into all its parts and qualities. It is the complete
subject matter for a discrimination which is only very partially
performed.
</p>
<p>
Thus the whole continuum of nature 'now-present' means one whole event
(a duration), rendered definite by the limitation 'now-present' and
extending over all events now-present. Namely, the various finite events
now-present for an awareness are all parts of one associated duration
which is a special type of event. A duration is in a sense unbounded;
for it is, within certain limitations, all that there is. It has the
property of completeness, limited by the condition 'now-present'; it is
a temporal slab of nature.
</p>
<p>
<b><a id="art16.2">16.2</a></b> This fact of nature as a present-whole
is forced on our apprehension by the character of perception. Perceptual
awareness is complex. There are the various types of sense-perception,
and differences in extensity and in intensity. There are also
differences in attention and in consequent clearness of awareness,
shading off into a dim knowledge of events barely on the threshold of
consciousness. Thus nature, as we know it, is a continuous stream of
happening immediately present and partly dissected by our perceptual
awareness into separated events with diverse qualities. Within this
present stream the perceived is not sharply differentiated from the
unperceived; there is always an indefinite 'beyond' of which we feel the
presence although we do not discriminate the qualities of the parts.
This knowledge of what is beyond discriminating perception is the basis
of the scientific doctrine of externality. There is a present-whole of
nature of which our detailed knowledge is dim and mediate and
inferential, but capable of determination by its congruity with clear
immediate perceptual facts.
</p>
<p>
<b>16.3</b> The condition 'now-present' specifies a particular duration.
It evidently refers to some relation; for 'now' is 'simultaneous with,'
and 'present' is 'in the presence of' or 'presented to.' Thus
'now-present' refers to some relation between the duration and something
else. This 'something else' is the event 'here-present,' which is the
definite connecting link between individual experienced knowledge and
self-sufficient nature. The essential existence of the event
'here-present' is the reason why perception is from within nature and is
not an external survey. It is the 'percipient event.' The percipient
event defines its associated duration, namely its corresponding 'all
nature.'
</p>
<p>
<b><a id="art16.4">16.4</a></b> The 'here' in 'here-present' also refers
to the specific relation between the percipient event and its associated
duration. It means 'here within the duration,' i.e. 'here within the
present continuum of nature.' Thus the relation between an event
'here-present' and its associated duration embodies in some form the
property of rest in the duration; for otherwise 'here' would be an
equivocation. The relation in any concrete case may be complex,
involving more than one meaning of 'here,' but the essential character
of the relation is that as we (according to the method of extensive
abstraction) properly diminish the extent of such an event, the property
of 'rest in' the associated duration becomes more obvious. When an event
has the property of being a percipient event unequivocally here within
an associated duration, we shall say that it is 'cogredient' with the
duration.
</p>
<p>
<b>16.5</b> An event can be cogredient with only one duration. To have
this relation to the duration it must be temporally present throughout
the duration and exhibit one specific meaning of 'here.' But a duration
can have many events cogredient with it. Namely any event, which is
temporally present throughout that duration and in relation to an event
here-present defines one specific meaning of 'there,' is an event
'there-present' which has the same relation of cogredience to that
duration and (to that extent) is (so far) potentially an event
'here-present' in that duration for some possible act of apprehension.
Thus cogredience is a condition for a percipient event yielding
unequivocal meanings to 'here' and 'now.'
</p>
<p>
The relation of cogredience presupposes that the duration extends over
the event; but the two relations must not be confounded. In the first
place a duration extends over events which are not temporally present
throughout it, so that the specification of the duration would not be a
complete answer to the question 'When?' as asked of the event. Secondly,
the question 'Where?' which means 'Where in the duration?' may not be
susceptible of the one definite answer 'There' which is only possible if
cogredience holds. The question 'Whither?' which contemplates change in
the 'there' of an event, definitely refers to events which are parts of
a duration but are not cogredient with it. Cogredience is the relation
of absolute position within a duration; we must remember that a duration
is a slab of nature and not a mere abstract stretch of time. Cogredience
is the relation which generates the consentient sets discussed in
<a href="#chap03">Chapter III</a> of Part I. The details of the deduction
belong to <a href="#part03">Part III</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>16.6</b> It is not necessary to assume that there is one event which
is the system of all nature throughout all time. For scientific purposes
the only unbounded events are durations and these are bounded in their
temporal extension.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art17"><b><i>17. The Constants of Externality</i></b></a>.
<b>17.1</b> The 'constants of externality' are those characteristics of
a perceptual experience which it possesses when we assign to it the
property of being an observation of the passage of external nature,
namely when we apprehend it. A fact which possesses these
characteristics, namely these constants of externality, is what we call
an 'event.'
</p>
<p>
A complete enumeration of these constants is not necessary for our
purpose; we only need a survey of just those elements in the
apprehension of externality from which the concepts of time, space and
material arise. In this survey the attitude of mind to be avoided is
exhibited in the questions, 'How, being in space, do we know it?' 'How,
being in time, do we know it?' and 'How, having material, do we know of
it?'
</p>
<p>
Again we are not considering <i>à priori</i> necessities, nor are we
appealing to <i>à priori</i> principles in proof. We are merely
investigating the characteristics which in experience we find belonging
to perceived facts when we invest them with externality. The constants
of externality are the conditions for nature, and determine the ultimate
concepts which are presupposed in science.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art17.2"><b>17.2</b></a> In order to enter upon this
investigation from the standpoint of habitual experience, consider the
simplest general questions which can be asked of a percipient of some
event in nature, 'Which?' 'What?' 'How?' 'When?' 'Where?' 'Whither?'
These six questions fall into two sets. The first three invite
specification of qualities and discrimination amid alternative entities;
the remaining three refer to the spatio-temporal relation of a part to a
whole within which in some sense the perceived part is located.
</p>
<p>
They can be construed as referring to events or to objects. The former
way of understanding them is evidently the more fundamental, for our
awareness of nature is directly an awareness of events or happenings,
which are the ultimate data of natural science. The conditions which
determine the nature of events can only be furnished by other events,
for there is nothing else in nature. A reference to objects is only a
way of specifying the character of an event. It is an error to conceive
of objects as causing an event, except in the sense that the characters
of antecedent events furnish conditions which determine the natures of
subsequent events.
</p>
<p>
<b>17.3</b> The ultimate nature of events has been blurred by the
confusion which seems to be introduced by its acknowledgment. Events
appear as indefinite entities without clear demarcations and with mutual
relations of baffling complexity. They seem, so to speak, deficient in
thinghood. A lump of matter or a charge of electricity in a position at
an instant, retaining its self-identity in other positions at succeeding
instants, seems a simple clue for the unravelling of the maze. This may
be unreservedly granted; but our purpose is to exhibit this conception
of spatio-temporal material in its true relation to events. When this
has been effected, the mechanical rigidity (so to speak) of the
traditional views of time, space and material is thereby lost, and the
way is opened for such readjustments as the advance of experimental
knowledge may suggest.
</p>
<p>
<b>17.4</b> The six questions of <a href="#art17.2">17.2</a> immediately
reveal that what is ultimate in nature is a set of determinate things,
each with its own relations to other things of the set. To say this is a
truism, for thought and judgment are impossible without determinate
subjects. But the reluctance to abandon a vague indetermination of
events has been an implicit reason for the refusal to consider them as
the ultimate natural entities.
</p>
<p>
This demarcation of events is the first difficulty which arises in
applying rational thought to experience. In perception no event exhibits
definite spatio-temporal limits. A continuity of transition is
essential. The definition of an event by assignment of demarcations is
an arbitrary act of thought corresponding to no perceptual experience.
Thus it is a basal assumption, essential for ratiocination relating to
perceptual experience, that there are definite entities which are
events; though in practice our experience does not enable us to identify
any such subject of thought, as discriminated from analogous subjects
slightly more or slightly less.
</p>
<p>
This assumption must not be construed either as asserting an atomic
structure of events, or as a denial of overlapping events. It merely
asserts the ideal possibility of perfect definiteness as to what does or
does not belong to an event which is the subject of thought, though such
definiteness cannot be achieved in human knowledge. It is the claim
which is implicit in every advance towards exact observation, namely
that there is something definite to be known. The assumption is the
first constant of externality, namely the belief that what has been
apprehended as a continuum, is a potentially definite complex of
entities for knowledge. The assumption is closely allied with the
conception of nature as 'given.' This conception is the thought of an
event as a thing which 'happened' apart from all theory and as a fact
self-sufficient for a knowledge discriminating it alone.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art18"><b><i>18. Extension</i></b></a>. <b>18.1</b> The second
constant of externality is the relation of extension which holds between
events. An event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x"> may 'extend over' an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="y">, i.e. in other
words <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="y"> may be part of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x">. The concepts of time and of space in
the main, though not entirely, arise from the empirically determined
properties of this relation of extension. It is evident from the
universal and uniform application of the spatio-temporal concepts that
they must arise from the utilisation of the simplest characteristics
without which no datum of knowledge would be recognised as an event
belonging to the order of nature. Extension is a relation of this type.
It is a property so simple that we hardly recognise it as such&mdash;it
of course is so. Thus the event which is the passage of the car is part
of the whole life of the street. Also the passage of a wheel is part of
the event which is the passage of the car. Similarly the event which is
the continued existence of the house extends over the event which is the
continued existence of a brick of the house, and the existence of the
house during one day extends over its existence during one specified
second of that day.
</p>
<p>
<b>18.2</b> Every element of space or of time (as conceived in science)
is an abstract entity formed out of this relation of extension (in
association at certain stages with the relation of cogredience) by means
of a determinate logical procedure (the method of extensive
abstraction). The importance of this procedure depends on certain
properties of extension which are laws of nature depending on empirical
verification. There is, so far as I know, no reason why they should be
so, except that they are. These laws will be stated in the succeeding
parts so far as is necessary to exemplify the definitions which are
there given and to show that these definitions really indicate the
familiar spatial and temporal entities which are utilised by science in
precise and determinate ways. Many of the laws can be logically proved
when the rest are assumed. But the proofs will not be given here, as our
aim is to investigate the structure of the ideas which we apply to
nature and the fundamental laws of nature which determine their
importance, and not to investigate the deductive science which issues
from them.
</p>
<p>
<b>18.3</b> The various elements of time and space are formed by the
repeated applications of the method of extensive abstraction. It is a
method which in its sphere achieves the same object as does the
differential calculus in the region of numerical calculation, namely it
converts a process of approximation into an instrument of exact thought.
The method is merely the systematisation of the instinctive procedure of
habitual experience. The approximate procedure of ordinary life is to
seek simplicity of relations among events by the consideration of events
sufficiently restricted in extension both as to space and as to time;
the events are then 'small enough.' The procedure of the method of
extensive abstraction is to formulate the law by which the approximation
is achieved and can be indefinitely continued. The complete series is
then defined and we have a 'route of approximation.' These routes of
approximation according to the variation of the details of their
formation are the points of instantaneous space (here called
'event-particles'), linear segments (straight or curved) between
event-particles (here called 'routes'), the moments of time (each of
which is all instantaneous nature), and the volumes incident in moments.
Such elements are the exactly determined concepts on which the whole
fabric of science rests.
</p>
<p>
<b>18.4</b> The parts of an event are the set of events (excluding
itself) which the given event extends over. It is a mistake to conceive
an event as the mere logical sum of its parts. In the first place if we
do so, we are necessarily driven back to conceive of more fundamental
entities, not events, which would not have the mere abstract logical
character which (on this supposition) events would then have. Secondly,
the parts of an event are not merely one set of non-overlapping events
exhausting the given event. They are the whole complex of events
contained in that event; for example, if <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/135.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a"> be the given event, and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/135.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a"> extends over and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.971ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/136.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b"> over <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c">, then <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/135.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a"> extends over <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c">
and both <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.971ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/136.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> are parts of <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/135.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a">. Thus an event has its own
substantial unity of being which is not an abstract derivative from
logical construction. The physical fact of the concrete unity of an
event is the foundation of the continuity of nature from which are
derived the precise laws of the mathematical continuity of time and
space. Not any two events are in combination just one event, though
there will be other events of which both are parts. We recur to this
point in Part III, <a href="#art29">art. 29</a>,
when considering the junction of events.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art19"><b><i>19. Absolute Position</i></b></a>. <b>19.1</b> The
third constant of externality is the fact (already explained) that an
event as apprehended is related to a complete whole of nature which
extends over it and is the duration associated with the percipient event
of that perception.
</p>
<p>
<b>19.2</b> The fourth constant of externality is the reference (already
explained) of the apprehended event to the percipient event which (when
sufficiently restricted in its temporal extension) has a definite
station within the associated duration.
</p>
<p>
<b>19.3</b> The fifth constant is the above-mentioned fact of the
definite station of a percipient event within its duration. Namely, when
the specious present is properly limited, there is a definite univocal
meaning to the relation 'here within the duration' of the percipient
event to the duration.
</p>
<p>
<b>19.4</b> Thus the third, fourth, and fifth constants of externality
convey its very essence, and without them our perceptual experience
appears as a disconnected dream. They embody the reference of an event
to a definite&mdash;an absolute&mdash;spatio-temporal position within a
definite whole of nature, which whole is defined and limited by the
actual circumstances of the perception. This position, or station,
within such a whole is presupposed in the questions, 'When?' 'Where?'
'Whither?'
</p>
<p>
<a id="art20"><b><i>20. The Community of Nature</i></b></a>. <b>20.1</b>
One other constant of externality is required in scientific thought. We
will call it the association of events with a 'community of nature.'
This sixth constant arises from the fragmentary nature of perceptual
knowledge. There are breaks in individual perception, and there are
distinct streams of perception corresponding to diverse percipients. For
example, as one percipient awakes daily to a fresh perceptual stream, he
apprehends the same external nature which can be comprised in one large
duration extending over all his days. Again the same nature and the same
events are apprehended by diverse percipients; at least, what they
apprehend is as though it were the same for all.
</p>
<p>
<b>20.2</b> Thus we distinguish between the qualities of events as in
individual perception&mdash;namely, the sense-data of
individuals&mdash;and the objective qualities of the actual events
within the common nature which is the datum for apprehension. In this
assumption of a nature common for all percipients, the immediate
knowledge of the individual percipient is entirely his perceptual
awareness derived from the bodily event 'now-present here.' But this
event occurs as related to the events of antecedent or concurrent
nature. Accordingly he is aware of these events as related to his bodily
event 'now-present here'; but his knowledge is thus mediate and
relative&mdash;namely, he only knows other events through the medium of
his body and as determined by relations to it. The event here-now,
comprising in general the bodily events, is the immediate event
conditioning awareness.
</p>
<p>
<b>20.3</b> The form that this awareness of nature takes is an awareness
of sense-objects now-present, namely qualities situated in the events
within the duration associated with the percipient event. Thus the
immediate awareness qualifies the events of the specious present. Thus
the common nature which is the object of scientific research has to be
constructed as an interpretation. This interpretation is liable to
error, and involves adjustments. This question is further considered in
the next chapter and in <a href="#part04">Part IV</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art21"><b><i>21. Characters of Events</i></b></a>. <b>21.1</b>
The characters of events arbitrarily marked out in nature are of
baffling complexity. There are two ways of obtaining events of a certain
simplicity. In the first place we may consider events cogredient with
our present duration. This is in fact to fix attention on a given
position in space and to consider what is now going on within it. The
spatial relations will be simplified, but (unless we are lucky) the
other characters will be very complex. The second method is to consider
events whose time-parts show a certain permanence of character. This is
in fact to follow the fortunes of objects, and may be termed the natural
mode of discriminating the continuous stream of external nature into
events. The importance of this mode of discrimination could only be
ascertained by experience.
</p>
<p>
<b>21.2</b> There is one essential event which each percipient
discriminates, namely that event of which each part, contained within
each successive duration that assumes for him the character of the
duration now-present, correspondingly assumes for him the character of
the event here-present. This event is the life of that organism which
links the percipient's awareness to external nature.
</p>
<p>
<b>21.3</b> The thesis of this chapter can finally be summarised as
follows: There is a structure of events and this structure provides the
framework of the externality of nature within which objects are located.
Any percept which does not find its position within this structure is
not for us a percept <i>of</i> external nature, though it may find its
explanation <i>from</i> external events as being derived from them. The
character of the structure receives its exposition from the quantitative
and qualitative relations of space and time. Space and time are
abstractions expressive of certain qualities of the structure. This
space-time abstraction is not unique, so that many space-time
abstractions are possible, each with its own specific relation to
nature. The particular space-time abstraction proper to a particular
observant mind depends on the character of the percipient event which is
the medium relating that mind to the whole of nature. In a space-time
abstraction, time expresses certain qualities of the passage of nature.
This passage has also been called the creative advance of nature. But
this passage is not adequately expressed by any one time-system. The
whole set of time-systems derived from the whole set of space-time
abstractions expresses the totality of those properties of the creative
advance which are capable of being rendered explicit in thought. Thus no
single duration can be completely concrete in the sense of representing
a possible whole of all nature without omission. For a duration is
essentially related to one space-time system and thus omits those
aspects of the passage which find expression in other space-time
systems. Accordingly there can be no duration whose bounding moments are
the first and last moments of creation.
</p>
<p>
Objects are entities recognised as appertaining to events ; they are the
recognita amid events. Events are named after the objects involved in
them and according to how they are involved.

<br>
OBJECTS</h2>

<p>
<a id="art22"><b><i>22. Types of Objects</i></b></a>. <b>22.1</b> We
have now to consider natural elements which are objects of various
types. There are in fact an indefinite number of such types
corresponding to the types of recognisable permanences in nature of
various grades of subtlety. It is only necessary here to attempt a rough
classification of those which are essential to scientific thought.
</p>
<p>
The consideration of objects introduces the concepts of
'matter'&mdash;or more vaguely, 'material'&mdash;of 'transmission' and
of 'causation.' These concepts express certain relations of objects to
events, but the relations are too complex to be fully expressed in such
simple terms.
</p>
<p>
<b>22.2</b> The essence of the perception of an object is recognition.
There is the primary recognition which is the awareness of permanence
within the specious present; there is the indefinite recognition (which
we may term 'recollection') which is the awareness of other perceptions
of the object as related to other events separate from the specious
present, but without any precise designation of the events; and there is
the definite recognition (which we may term 'memory') which is an
awareness of perception of the object as related to certain other
definite events separate from the specious present.
</p>
<p>
<b>22.3</b> The awareness of external nature is an awareness of a
duration, which is the being of nature throughout the specious present,
and of a complex of events, each being part of the present duration.
These events fall into two sets. In one set is the percipient event and
in the other are the external events whose peculiar property, which has
led to their discernment, is that they are the situations of
sense-objects.
</p>
<p>
<b>22.4</b> The percipient event is discerned as the locus of a
recognisable permanence which is the 'percipient object.' This object is
the unity of the awareness whose recognition leads to the classification
of a train of percipient events as the natural life associated with one
consciousness. The discussion of the percipient object leads us beyond
the scope of this enquiry. Owing to the temporal duration of the
immediate present the self-knowledge of the percipient object is a
knowledge of the unity of the consciousness within other parts of the
immediate present. Thus, though it is a knowledge of what is immediately
present, it is not a knowledge knowing itself.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art23"><b><i>23. Sense-Objects</i></b></a>. <b>23.1</b> The
sense-object is the simplest permanence which we trace as self-identical
in external events. It is some definite sense-datum, such as the colour
red of a definite shade. We see redness here and the same redness there,
redness then and the same redness now. In other words, we perceive
redness in the same relation to various definite events, and it is the
same redness which we perceive. Tastes, colours, sounds, and every
variety of sensation are objects of this sort.
</p>
<p>
<b>23.2</b> There is no apprehension of external events apart from
recognitions of sense-objects as related to them, and there is no
recognition of sense-objects except as in relation to external events.
</p>
<p>
In so far as recognition of a sense-object is confined to primary
recognition within the present duration, the sense-object and the event
do not clearly disentangle themselves; recollection and memory are the
chief agents in producing a clear consciousness of a sense-object. But
apart from recollection and memory, any factor, perceived as situated in
an external event, which might occur again and which is not a relation
between other such factors, is a sense-object. Sense-objects form the
ultimate type of perceived objects (other than percipient objects) and
do not express any permanence of relatedness between perceived objects
of yet more fundamental types.
</p>
<p>
<b>23.3</b> A sense-object, such as a particular shade of redness, has a
variety of relations to the events of nature. These relations are not
explicable in terms of the two-termed relations to which attention is
ordinarily confined.
</p>
<p>
The events which (in addition to the sense-object) enter as terms into
such a relation can be classified into three sets (not mutually
exclusive), namely (i) percipient events, (ii) events which are
'situations' of the sense-object, (iii) conditioning events.
</p>
<p>
<b>23.4</b> A percipient event in the polyadic relation of a
sense-object to nature is the percipient event of an awareness which
includes the recognition of that sense-object. An event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> is a
situation of the sense-object for that percipient event when for the
associated awareness the sense-object is a quality of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">. Now
perception involves essentially both a percipient event and an
associated duration within which that percipient event is set and with
which it is cogredient. A situation of a sense-object in respect to a
given percipient event occurs within the associated duration of the
percipient event. In fact the content of the awareness derived from a
given percipient event is merely the associated duration as extending
over a complex of events which are situations of sense-objects of
perception and also as extending over the percipient event itself. For
example, an astronomer looks through a telescope and sees a new red star
burst into existence. He sees redness situated in some event which is
happening now and whose spatial relations to other events, though fairly
determinate as to direction from him, are very vague as to distance.
</p>
<p>
<b>23.5</b> We say that what he really sees is a star coming into being
two centuries previously. But the relation of the event 'really seen' to
the percipient event and to the redness is an entirely different one
from that of the event 'seen' to these same entities. It is only the
incurable poverty of language which blurs the distinction.
</p>
<p>
This distinction between what is 'perceived' and what is 'really
perceived' does not solely arise from time differences. For example
Alciphron, in Berkeley's dialogue, sees a crimson cloud. Suppose that he
had seen the cloud in a mirror. He would have 'seen' crimson as situated
in an event behind the mirror, but he would have 'really seen' the cloud
behind him.
</p>
<p>
These examples show that the property of being the situation of a
sense-object for a given percipient event is in some respects a trivial
property of an event. Yet, in other respects, it is very important;
namely, it is important for the consciousness associated with the
percipient event. The situations of sense-objects form the whole basis
of our knowledge of nature, and the whole structure of natural knowledge
is founded on the analysis of their relations.
</p>
<p>
<b>23.6</b> The definiteness for human percipients of the situations of
sense-objects varies greatly for different types of such objects. The
sound of a bell is in the bell, it fills the room, and jars the brain.
The feeling a push against a hard rock is associated with the rock as
hardness and with the body as effort, where hardness and effort are
objects of sense. This duplication of sense-objects is a normal fact in
perception, though one of the two associated pair, either the one in the
body or the one in a situation separated from the body, is usually
faintly perceived and indeterminate as to situation.
</p>
<p>
<b>23.7</b> The relationship between a sense-object and nature, so far
as it is restricted to one percipient event and one situation, is
completed by the conditioning events. The special characters in which
they enter into that relationship depend on the particular case under
consideration. Conditioning events may be divided into two main classes
which are not strictly discriminated from each other. Namely, there are
the events which are 'passive' conditions and the events which are
'active' conditions. An event which is an active condition is a cause of
the occurrence of the sense-object in its situation for the percipient
event; at least, it can be so termed in one of the many meanings of the
word 'cause.' Also space and time are presupposed as the setting within
which the particular events occur. But space and time are merely
expressive of the relations of extension among the whole ether of
events. Thus this presupposition of space and time really calls in all
events of all nature as passive conditions for that particular
perception of the sense-object. The laws of nature express the
characters of the active conditioning events and of the percipient
events, which issue in the recognition of a definite sense-object in an
assigned situation.
</p>
<p>
<b>23.8</b> The discovery of laws of nature depends on the fact that in
general certain simple types of character of active conditioning events
repeat themselves. These are the normal causes of the recognitions of
sense-objects. But there are abnormal causes and part of the task in the
analysis of natural law is to understand how the abnormal causes are
consistent with those laws. For example, the normal cause of the sight
of a colour in a situation (near by) is the rectilinear transmission of
light (during the specious present) from the situation to the percipient
event through intervening events. The introduction of a mirror
introduces abnormality. This is an abnormality of a minor sort. An
example of major abnormality is when there is no transmission of light
at all. The excessive consumption of alcohol produces delirium and
illusions of sight. In this example the active conditioning events are
of a totally different character from those involving the transmission
of light. The perception is a delusion in the sense that it suggests the
normal conditioning events instead of the abnormal conditioning events
which have actually occurred. Abnormal conditioning events are in no way
necessarily associated with error. For example, recollection and memory
are perceptions with abnormal conditioning events; and indeed in any
abnormal circumstances error only arises when the circumstances are not
recognised for what they are.
</p>
<p>
<b><a id="art23.9">23.9</a></b> Whereas the situations of a sense-object
are always simultaneous with the associated percipient event, the active
conditioning events are in general antecedent to it. These active
conditioning events in general are divisible into two classes not very
clearly separated, namely the generating events and the transmitting
events. This classification is especially possible in the case of
perception under normal circumstances.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art24"><b><i>24. Perceptual Objects</i></b></a>. <b>24.1</b>
Perceptual objects are the ordinary objects of common
experience&mdash;chairs, tables, stones, trees. They have been termed
'permanent possibilities of sensation.' These objects are&mdash;at least
for human beings&mdash;the most insistent of all natural objects. They
are the 'things' which we see, touch, taste, and hear. The fact of the
existence of such objects is among the greatest of all laws of nature,
ranking with those from which space and time emerge.
</p>
<p>
A perceptual object is recognised as an association of sense-objects in
the same situation. The permanence of the association is the object
which is recognised. It is not the case however that sense-objects are
only perceived as associated in perceptual objects. There is always a
perception of sense-objects&mdash;some sounds, for instance&mdash;not so
associated. Furthermore, a sense-object associated in a perceptual
object is perceived both as itself and as 'conveying' the perceptual
object. For example, we see both the horse and the colour of the horse,
but what we see (in the strict sense of the term) is simply colour in a
situation.
</p>
<p>
<b>24.2</b> This property of 'conveying' an object is fundamental in the
recognition of perceptual objects. It is the chief example of abnormal
perception of sense-objects. It is already well-known in the theory of
art-criticism, as is evidenced in such phrases as 'tactile-values' or
again in such simple phrases as 'painting water so that it looks wet.'
</p>
<p>
The conveyance of a perceptual object by a sense-object is not primarily
a judgment. It is a sensuous perception of sense-objects, definite as to
situation but not very determinate as to exact character. Judgments
quickly supervene and form an important ingredient of what may be termed
'completed recognition.' These judgments will be called 'perceptual
judgments.'
</p>
<p>
<b>24.3</b> Thus in the completed recognition of a perceptual object we
discern (i) the primary recognition of one or more sense-objects in the
same situation, (ii) the conveyance of other sense-objects by these
primary recognitions, and (iii) the perceptual judgment as to the
character of the perceptual object which in its turn influences the
character of the sense-objects conveyed.
</p>
<p>
The content of the perceptual judgment is (i) that an analogous
association of sense-objects, with 'legal' modifications and in the same
situation as that actually apprehended, is recognisable from other
percipient events, and (ii) that the event which is the common situation
of these associations of sense-objects, recognised or recognisable, is
an active condition for these recognitions.
</p>
<p>
24.4 The situation of a perceptual object is what we call the
'generating' event among the active conditions for the associated
sense-objects, provided that the perceptual judgment is correct.
</p>
<p>
If the perceptual judgment is false, the perceptual object as perceived
is a delusion.
</p>
<p>
The situation of a non-delusive perceptual object is independent of any
particular percipient event.
</p>
<p>
<b><a id="art24.5">24.5</a></b> Amid the development of events the same
non-delusive perceptual object may be perceived in a developed
situation, again with 'legal' modifications of the association of
perceived sense-objects. The verbal analysis of what constitutes a legal
modification of the association without breach of the essence of the
observed permanence would be impossibly complex in each particular case;
but the judgment as to what is allowable in modification is immediate in
practice, apart from exceptional cases.
</p>
<p>
A non-delusive perceptual object will be called a 'physical object.'
</p>
<p>
It is an essential characteristic of a physical object that its
situation is an active condition for its perception. For this reason the
object itself is often named as the cause. But the object is only
derivatively the cause by its relation to its situation. Primarily a
cause is always an event, namely, an active condition.
</p>
<p>
<b>24.6</b> The apprehension of an event as the situation of a physical
object is our most complete perception of the character of an event. It
represents a fundamental perception of a primary law of nature. It is
solely by means of physical objects that our knowledge of events as
active conditions is obtained, whether as generating conditions or as
transmitting conditions. For example, the mirror is recognised as a
physical object and its situation is the generating condition for that
association of sense-objects; but its situation is also a transmitting
condition for the sense-objects and delusive perceptual objects which
are perceived as images behind it. Again, the prism is a physical object
and its situation is a transmitting condition for the sense-object which
is the spectrum.
</p>
<p>
So far as it is directly perceived in its various situations, a physical
object is a group of associations of sense-objects, each association
being perceived or perceivable by a percipient object with an
appropriate percipient event as its locus. But the object is more than
the logical group; it is the recognisable permanent character of its
various situations.
</p>
<p>
<b>24.7</b> In spite of their insistence in perception these physical
objects are infected with an incurable vagueness which had led
speculative physics practically to cut them out of its scheme of
fundamental entities. In the first place this vagueness arises from the
unique situation of such an object within any small duration. The result
is that the object is confounded with the event which is its situation.
But a situation is prolonged in time, and a temporal part of that event
is not the event itself. Now the object during ten seconds is not part
of the object during one of these seconds. The object is always wholly
itself during ten seconds or during one second. It is this train of
thought which led to the introduction of the durationless instant of
time as a fundamental fact, thus fatally confusing the philosophy of
science. The error arose from not discriminating the object from its
situation. The train of events which is the situation of the object
through a prolonged stretch of time is not the unique object; it is the
set of events with which the object has its unique association. The
difficulty of this point of view arises from the fact that a temporal
succession of events, each very similar to the others, ceases to mark
for us the time-flux in comparison with the rhythmic changes of our
bodies. The result is that in perceiving an unchanging cliff the
recognition of permanence, i.e. of the object, overwhelms all other
perception, the flux of events becoming a vague background owing to the
absence of their demarcation in our perceptual experience.
</p>
<p>
<b>24.8</b> The essential unity of the object amid the spatial parts of
its situation is more difficult to grasp. The derivation of space and
time by the method of extensive analysis, as explained in
<a href="#part03">Part III</a> of this enquiry, exhibits the essential
identity of extension in time and extension in space. Thus the reasons
for denying temporal parts of an object are also reasons for denying to
it spatial parts. Again, it is true that the leg of a chair occupies
part of the space which is occupied by the chair. But in appealing to
space we are appealing to relations between events. What we are saying
is, that the situation of the leg of the chair is part of the situation
of the chair. This fact only makes the leg to be part of the chair in a
mediate derivative sense, by way of their relations to their situations.
But the leg is one object with a recognisable permanence of association,
and the chair is another, with recognisable permanence of association
distinct from that of the leg, and their situations in all circumstances
have certain definite relations to each other expressible
<a id="FNanchor_5_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
in temporal and spatial terms.
</p>
<p>
<b>24.9</b> The second reason for the vagueness of physical objects is
the impossibility of submitting the group of associations, forming the
object, to any process of determination with a progressive approximation
to precision. A physical object is one of those entities of ordinary
experience which refuse to be pressed into the service of science by way
of a progressive exactness of determination. Consider for example a
definite object such as a certain woollen sock. It wears thin, but it
remains the same object; it is darned, and remains the same object;
finally after successive repairs no part of the original wool is left,
but it is the same sock. The truth is that each time we affirm the
self-identity of this object we are construing the group of
associations, which we recognise, in a more and more attenuated sense.
The object which is both the sock at the end and the sock at the
beginning is a very attenuated complex type of permanence, which would
not be what we meant by the sock merely at the beginning of its career
or as perceived merely at the end of its career. By insisting on the
continued identity of the sock, we are in fact continually juggling with
what we mean by the sock, always retaining the most complete
associations which we can trace through the whole continuous series of
events forming the successive situations of the sock. The physical
object 'works' perfectly for the ordinary usage of life, and is thus
fully justified for that purpose in the eyes of the pragmatic
philosopher.
</p>
<p>
<b>24.91</b> But these objects do represent essential facts of nature;
sometimes, as it may seem to us, trivial facts not worth disentangling
from the events which are their situations, sometimes useful facts. But
their essential character is exemplified when we reach biological facts.
A living organism exhibits a certain unity of being which is merely the
exhibition of the enhanced importance of the unity of the physical
object.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art25"><b><i>25. Scientific Objects</i></b></a>. <b>25.1</b> The
various types of scientific objects arise from the determination of the
characters of the active conditioning events which are essential factors
in the recognition of sense-objects.
</p>
<p>
The perceptual judgment which is present in the completed recognition of
physical objects introduces the notion of hypothetical perceptions by
percipient objects, located for an indefinite number of hypothetical
percipient events. In other words, it is a judgment on the events of the
universe as being favourable active conditions for the perception of the
physical object, granting the correspondingly favourable percipient
events. There are an indefinite number of such percipient events, actual
or imaginary. The characters of events as active conditions are to be
inferred from their adjustment to these innumerable possibilities of
perception of each physical object.
</p>
<p>
<b>25.2</b> Also in another way physical objects are the links
connecting nature as perceived with nature as conditioning its own
perception. Physical objects are often termed the causes of the
perception of sense-objects, other than the sense-objects which are
among their own components. For example, the telescope is the cause of
the astronomer's seeing the star. But a physical object is a cause only
in an indirect mediate sense. The fact of the telescope being in the
right position at the right time was an active condition for the
astronomer's sight of the star. Now this fact is an event which is a
'situation' of the telescope. Thus in our experience the situations of
physical objects are discovered to be active conditions for the
perception of sense-objects. In this way a knowledge of the characters
of events, in so far as they are active conditions, can be observed and
inferred; and the passage from perception to causation is effected.
</p>
<p>
<b>25.3</b> At once the question arises, In what terms are the
characters of the conditioning events to be expressed? The unanimous
answer has been, that the expression is to be in terms of 'matter,'
or&mdash;allowing for the more subtle ether—in terms of 'material.' In
so deciding none of the distinctions made above have been consistently
held in view. The result has been the persistent lapses into confusion
which have been exhibited in a brief abstract in the first part of this
enquiry.
</p>
<p>
Matter has been classified into the various kinds of matter which are
the chemical substances; thence the atomic theory of matter has been
established; and thence some form of electromagnetic theory of molecules
is emerging. It is in the last degree unlikely that the present form of
this theory will represent its final stage. All novel theories emerge
with a childlike simplicity which they ultimately shed. But, apart from
specific details, it can as little be doubted that in its main concepts
the theory is true.
</p>
<p>
<b>25.4</b> We will accordingly pass by the elaborate task of tracking
down and interpreting intermediate stages of scientific
concepts—important though they are&mdash;and pass at once to the
consideration of molecules and electrons. The characters of events in
their capacity of active conditioning events for sense-objects are
expressed by their relations to scientific objects. Scientific objects
are not directly perceived, they are inferred by reason of their
capacity to express these characters, namely, they express how it is
that events are conditions. In other words they express the causal
characters of events.
</p>
<p>
<b>25.5</b> At the present epoch the ultimate scientific objects are
electrons. Each such scientific object has its special relation to each
event in nature. Events as thus related to a definite electron are
called the 'field' of that object. The relations of the object to
different parts of the field are interconnected; and, when the
relationship of the object to certain parts of the field is known, its
relationship to the remaining parts can be calculated.
</p>
<p>
As here defined the field of an electron extends through all time and
all space, each event bearing a certain character expressed by its
relation to the electron. As in the case of other objects, the electron
is an atomic unity, only mediately in space and in time by reason of its
specific relations to events. This field is divisible into two parts,
namely, the 'occupied' events and the 'unoccupied' events. The occupied
event corresponds to the situation of a physical object. In
order to express these relations of an electron to events with
sufficient simplicity, the method of extensive abstraction [cf.
<a href="#part03">Part III</a>] has to be employed. The success of this
method depends on the principle of convergence to simplicity with
diminution of extent. The result is to separate off the temporal and
spatial properties of events. The relations of electrons to events can
be expressed in terms of spatial positions and spatial motions at all
instants throughout the whole of time.
</p>
<p>
<b>25.6</b> In terms of space and time (as derived by the method of
extensive abstraction) the situation of a physical object shrinks into
its spatial position at an instant together with its associated motion.
Also an event occupied by an electron shrinks into the position at an
instant of the electric charge forming its nucleus, together with its
associated motion. But the quantitative charge is entirely devoid of
character apart from its associated field; it expresses the character of
the occupied events which is due to their relation to the electron. Its
permanence of quantity reflects the permanence which is recognised in
the electron, considered for itself alone.
</p>
<p>
<b>25.7</b> The 'unoccupied' events possess a definite character
expressive of the reign of law in the creative advance of nature, i.e.
in the passage of events. This type of character of events unoccupied by
the electron is also shared by the occupied events. It expresses the
rôle of the electron as an agency in the passage of events. In fact the
electron is nothing else than the expression of certain permanent
recognisable features in this creative advance.
</p>
<p>
Thus the character of event e which it receives from electron <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A">,
which does not occupy it, is one of the influences which govern the
change of electron <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="B">, which does occupy <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">, into the occupation
of other events succeeding <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">. The complete rule of change for <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="B">
can be expressed in terms of the complete character which e receives
from its relations to all the electrons in the universe. </p>
<p>
<b>25.8</b> The connectedness of the characters which events receive
from a given electron is expressed by the notion of transmission, namely
the characters are transmitted from the occupied events according to a
regular rule, which depends on the continuity of events arising from
their mutual relations of extension. This transmission through events is
expressible as a transmission through space with finite velocity.
</p>
<p>
<b>25.9</b> Thus in an event unoccupied by it an electron is discerned
only as an agent modifying the character of that event; whereas in an
event occupied by it the electron is discerned as itself acted on,
namely the character of that event governs the fate of the electron.
Thus in a sense there is no action at a distance; for the fate of each
electron is wholly determined by the event it occupies. But in a sense
there is action at a distance, since the character of any event is
modified (to however slight a degree) by any other electron, however
separated by intervening events. This action at a distance is in its
turn limited to being a transmission through the intervening events.

<a id="art26"><b><i>26. Duality of Nature</i></b></a>. <b>26.1</b> There
are two sides to nature, as it were, antagonistic the one to the other,
and yet each essential. The one side is development in creative advance,
the essential becomingness of nature. The other side is the permanence
of things, the fact that nature can be recognised. Thus nature is always
a newness relating objects which are neither new nor old.
</p>
<p>
<b>26.2</b> Perception fades unless it is equally stimulated from both
sides of nature. It is essentially apprehension of the becomingness of
nature. It requires transition, contrast, and newness, and immediacy of
happening. Thus essentially perception is an awareness of events in the
act of passing into what has never yet been. But equally perception
requires recognition. Now electrons&mdash;in so far as they are ultimate
scientific objects and if they are such objects&mdash;do not satisfy the
complete condition for recognisability.
</p>
<p>
<b>26.3</b> Such ultimate scientific objects embody what is ultimately
permanent in nature. Thus they are the objects whose relations in events
are the unanalysable expression of the order of nature. But the
recognition in perception requires the recurrence of the ways in which
events pass. This involves the rhythmic repetition of the characters of
events. This permanence of rhythmic repetition is the essential
character of molecules, which are complex scientific objects. There is
no such thing as a molecule at an instant. A molecule requires a minimum
of duration in which to display its character. Similarly physical
objects are steady complexes of molecules with an average permanence of
character throughout certain minimum durations.
</p>
<p>
<b>26.4</b> Thus the recognition which is involved in perception is the
reason for the importance in physical science of Lorentz's hierarchy of
microscopic and macroscopic equations.
</p>
<p>
<b>26.5</b> The further consideration of objects, in particular their
instantaneous spatial positions and the quantitative distribution of
material through space, is resumed in <a href="#part04">Part IV</a>,
after the theory of space and time has been established.

<p>
<a id="art28"><b><i>28. Intersection,Separation and
Dissection</i></b></a>. <b>28.1</b> Two events 'intersect' when they
have parts in common. Intersection, as thus defined, includes the case
when one event extends over the other, since <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/138.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> is transitive. If
every intersector of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.971ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/136.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b"> also intersects <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/135.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a">, then either <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 4.179ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/137.svg" alt=" " data-tex="aKb"> or

</p>
<p>
Events which do not intersect are said to be 'separated.' A 'separated
set' of events is a set of events of which any two are separated from
each other.
</p>
<p>
<b>28.2</b> A 'dissection' of an event is a separated set such that the
set of intersectors of its members is identical with the set of
intersectors of the event. Thus a dissection is a non-overlapping
exhaustive analysis of an event into a set of parts, and conversely the
dissected event is the one and only event of which that set is a
dissection. There will always be an indefinite number of dissections of
any given event.
</p>
<p>
If <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 4.179ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/137.svg" alt=" " data-tex="aKb">, there are dissections of <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/135.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a"> of which <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.971ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/136.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b"> is a

<a id="art29"><b><i>29. The Junction of Events</i></b></a>. <b>29.1</b>
Two events <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="y"> are 'joined' when there is a third event such
that (i) <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.052ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/144.svg" alt=" " data-tex="z"> intersects both <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="y">, and (ii) there is a
dissection of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.052ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/144.svg" alt=" " data-tex="z"> of which each member is a part of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x">, or of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="y">, or of both.
</p>
<p>
The concept of the continuity of nature arises entirely from this
relation of the junction between two events. Two joined events are
continuous one with the other. Intersecting events are necessarily
joined; but the notion of junction is wider than that of intersection,
for it is possible for two separated events to be joined. Two events
which are joined have that relation to each other necessary for the
existence of one event which extends over them and over no extraneous
events. Two events which are both separated and joined are said to be
'adjoined.'
</p>
<p>
<b>29.2</b> An event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x"> is said to 'injoin' an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="y"> when

<p>
In this definition a property of the boundary of an event first makes
its appearance. The assumption that examples of the relation of
injunction hold is a long step towards a theory of such boundaries, as
the annexed diagram illustrates. It is important to note that injunction
has been defined purely in terms of extension.
</p>
<p>
If <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 4.414ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/145.svg" alt=" " data-tex="xKy"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.052ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/144.svg" alt=" " data-tex="z"> is separated from <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x"> and adjoins <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/134.svg" alt=" " data-tex="y">, then

</p>
<p>
<b>29.3</b> Injunction and adjunction are the closest types of boundary
union possible respectively for an event with its part and for a pair of
separated events. The geometry for events is four-dimensional, but in
the three-dimensional analogue such a surface union for a pair of
volumes would be the existence of a finite area of surface in common.
</p>
<p>
[Note that spatial diagrams, such as the one above, are to some extent
misleading in that they emphasise the spatial character of events at the
expense of their temporal character. The temporal character is very far
from being represented by an extra dimension producing an ordinary
four-dimensional euclidean geometry.]
</p>
<p>
<a id="art30"><b><i>30. Abstractive Classes</i></b></a>. <b>30.1</b> A
set of events is called an 'abstractive class' when (i) of any two of
its members one extends over the other, and (ii) there is no event which
is extended over by every event of the set.
</p>
<p>
The properties of an abstractive class secure that its members form a
series in which the predecessors extend over their successors, and that
the extension of the members of the series (as we pass towards the
'converging end' comprising the smaller members) diminishes without
limit; so that there is no end to the series in this direction along it
and the diminution of the extension finally excludes any assignable
event. Thus any property of the individual events which survives
throughout members of the series as we pass towards the converging end
is a property belonging to an ideal simplicity which is beyond that of
any one assignable event. There is no one event which the series marks
out, but the series itself is a route of approximation towards an ideal
simplicity of 'content.' The systematic use of these abstractive classes
is the 'method of extensive abstraction.' All the spatial and temporal
concepts can be defined by means of them.
</p>
<p>
<b>30.2</b> One class of events&mdash;<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, say&mdash;is said to

event which is extended over by every member of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">. For any

<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">. The usual case of covering is when both classes, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">

<p>
<b>30.3</b> Two classes of events are called '<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/138.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">-equal' when each
covers the other. Evidently such classes cannot have a finite number of
members. Inequality is a relation in which two abstractive classes can
stand to each other. The relation is symmetrical and transitive, and
every abstractive class is <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/138.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">-equal to itself.

Thus one pair of opposite sides is of the same length throughout the
whole series. Then each rectangle extends over all the subsequent
rectangles. Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.451ex; height: 1.927ex;" src="images/148.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h_{n}">, tend to zero as <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/149.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> increases indefinitely.
Then the set forms an abstractive class.
</p>
<p>
Evidently the set of squares converges to a point, and the set of
rectangles to a straight line. Similarly, using three dimensions and
volumes, we can thus diagrammatically find abstractive classes which
converge to areas. If we suppose the centre of the set of squares to be
the same as that of the set of rectangles, and place the squares so that
their sides are parallel to the sides of the rectangles, then the set of
rectangles covers the set of squares, but the set of squares does not
cover the set of rectangles.
</p>
<p>
Again, consider a set of concentric circles with their common centre at
the centre of the squares, and let each circle be inscribed in one of
the squares, and let each square have one of the circles inscribed in
it. Then the circles form an abstractive class converging to their
common centre. The set of squares covers the set of circles and the set
of circles covers the set of squares. Accordingly the two sets are

<b>31.4</b> Errors arise unless we remember the existence of some
exceptional abstractive classes. Since we assume that each event has a
definite demarcation we know that the laws of nature ordinarily assumed
in science will issue in ascribing to each event a definite boundary
which will be a spatial surface prolonged into three dimensions by
reason of its time-extension. Thus the possibilities of the spatial
contact of surfaces are reproduced in the three-dimensional boundaries
of events. Abstractive classes exist whose converging ends converge to
elements [instantaneous points, or routes, or etc.] on the surface of
one of the members of the class. In such a case, as we pass down the
abstractive class towards its converging end, after some definite member
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x"> of the class the remaining members, all extended over by <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x">,

also be more abstract types of point-contact or of line-contact which we
have not defined here, but know about from their occurrence in geometry.
If we merely exclude such cases without explicit definition, we are
really appealing to fundamental relations and properties which have not
been explicitly recognised. We must use definitions based solely upon
those properties of the relation <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/138.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> which have been made explicit. We
cannot explicitly take account of point-contact till points have been

DURATIONS, MOMENTS AND

<a id="art33"><b><i>33. Antiprimes, Durations and Moments</i></b></a>.
<b>33.1</b> Among the constants of externality discussed in <a
href="#part02">Part II</a> was the reference of events to durations
which are, in a sense, complete wholes of nature. A duration has thus in
some sense an unlimited extension, though it is bounded in its temporal
extent. Although we have not yet in our investigation of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/138.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">
distinguished between spatial and temporal extension, durations can
nevertheless be defined in terms of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/138.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> by this unlimited aspect of
their extents. Namely, we assume that there are no other events with the
same unlimited property. Accordingly, any abstractive class which is
composed purely of durations can only be covered by abstractive classes
which also are composed purely of durations.
</p>
<p>
<b>33.2</b> An abstractive class <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> is called an 'absolute
antiprime' when <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> is itself one of the antiprimes which satisfy
the formative condition of covering <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">. In other words, an
absolute antiprime is an abstractive class which covers every
abstractive class which covers it.
</p>
<p>
If an abstractive class be an absolute antiprime, it is evident that the
formative condition of 'covering it' is regular for antiprimes. Thus the
set of events which are members of the absolute antiprimes which cover
some one assigned absolute antiprime constitutes an abstractive element.
Such an element will be called a 'moment.' Thus a moment is an
abstractive element deduced from the condition of covering an absolute
antiprime.
</p>
<p>
Only events of a certain type can be members of an absolute antiprime,
namely events which in <a href="#part02">Part II</a> have been called
'durations.' Only durations can extend over durations, and accordingly
all the members of a moment are durations.
</p>
<p>
33.3 We may conceive of a duration as a sort of temporal thickness
(or, slab) of nature<a id="FNanchor_6_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
In an absolute antiprime we have a series of temporal thicknesses
successively packed one inside the other and converging towards the
ideal of no thickness. An absolute antiprime indicates the ideal of an
extensionless moment of time.
</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nind">
<a id="Footnote_6_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_1"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>The slab of nature forming a duration is limited in its temporal
dimension and unlimited in its spatial dimensions. Thus it represents
a finite time and infinite space.

have assumed only one time-system, which is the Newtonian hypothesis.
Suppose there are many time-systems and consider two such systems
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">. These are represented by two lines inclined to
each other. A duration of time-system <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> is represented by the
area between <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 3.414ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/156.svg" alt=" " data-tex="AB"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.593ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/158.svg" alt=" " data-tex="CD">, and a duration of time-system <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">
is represented by the area between <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 3.423ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/159.svg" alt=" " data-tex="EF"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 4.02ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/160.svg" alt=" " data-tex="HK">. Two such durations
necessarily intersect and also can neither completely extend over the
other.
</p>
<p>
These diagrams are crude illustrations of some properties of durations
and are in many respects misleading as the sequel will show.
</p></div>

<p>
The set of moments which inhere in a duration are completely
characteristic of that duration, and vice versa. A moment is to be
conceived as an abstract of all nature at an instant. No abstractive
element can cover a moment except that moment itself. A moment is a
route of approximation to all nature which has lost its (essential)
temporal extension; thus it is nature under the aspect of a
three-dimensional instantaneous space. This is the ideal to which we
endeavour to approximate in our exact observations.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art34"><b><i>34. Parallelism and Time-Systems</i></b></a>.
<b>34.1</b> If the Newtonian theory of relativity were true, no pair of
durations would lack durations extending over both of them, namely
larger durations including both the given durations. But on the
electromagnetic theory of relativity this is not necessarily the case,
namely some pairs of durations are extended over by a family of
durations and some are not. We shall adopt the electromagnetic theory of
relativity.
</p>
<p>
A pair of durations both of which are parts of the same duration are
called 'parallel'; and also a pair of moments such that there are
durations in which both inhere are called 'parallel.'
</p>
<p>
Parallelism has the usual properties of transitiveness, symmetry and
reflexiveness. Also two durations which do not intersect are parallel;
and parallel moments which are not identical never intersect. If two
parallel durations intersect there is a duration which is their complete
intersection, but there are no durations among the common parts of two
durations which are not parallel. Two moments which are not parallel
necessarily intersect.

<p>
<b>34.2</b> Two durations which are parallel to the same duration are
parallel to each other; thus it is evident that each absolute antiprime
and each moment must be composed of parallel durations.
</p>
<p>
A 'family of parallel durations' is formed by all the durations parallel
to a given duration, including that duration itself. Evidently any two
members of such a family are parallel, and no duration out of the family
is parallel to any duration of the family.
</p>
<p>
Analogously to such families of parallel durations, there are families
of parallel moments, with the property that no two moments of the same
family intersect and that any moment out of a given family intersects
every moment belonging to the family.
</p>
<p>
The durations which are the members of the various moments of a given
family of moments themselves form a family of parallel durations. Thus
corresponding to a family of parallel durations there is one and only
one family of parallel moments; and corresponding to a family of
parallel moments there is one and only one family of parallel durations.
A pair of such corresponding families, one of durations and the other of
moments, form the 'time-system' associated with either of the two
families.
</p>
<p>
Evidently each duration belongs to one and only one family of parallel
durations; and thus each duration belongs to one and only one
time-system. Also each moment belongs to one and only one family of
parallel moments; and thus each moment belongs to one and only one
time-system. Thus two distinct time-systems have no durations in common
and no moments in common. But every event not a duration is contained in
some durations of any given time-system. Furthermore there will be a
minimum duration in a given time-system which is the duration 'when' the
event happened in that time-system; namely, the minimum duration has the
properties (i) that it extends over the event and (ii) that every
duration which is part of it intersects the event.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art34.3"><b>34.3</b></a> The moments of a time-system are arranged
in serial order in this way:
</p>
<p>
(i) A duration belonging to a time-system is 'bounded' by a moment of

intersects the given duration and also intersects events separated from
the given duration:

<a id="art35"><b><i>35. Levels, Rects, and Puncts</i></b></a>.
<b>35.1</b> The electromagnetic theory of relativity is obviously the
more general of the two. It has also the merit of providing definitions
of flatness, of straightness, of punctual position, of parallelism, of
time-order and spatial order as interconnected phenomena, and (with the
help of cogredience) of perpendicularity and of congruence. The theory
of extension has also provided the definition of a duration. It is a
remarkable fact that the characteristic concepts of time and of geometry
should thus be exhibited as arising out of the nature of things as
expressed by the two fundamental relations of extension and cogredience.
It has already been explained that a moment is the route of
approximation towards an instantaneous three-dimensional whole of
nature. The set of abstractive elements and abstractive classes covered
by both of two non-parallel moments is the locus which is their common
intersection. Such a locus will be called a 'level' in either moment. A
level is in fact an instantaneous plane in the instantaneous space of
any moment in which it lies. But we reserve the conventional spatial
terms, such as 'plane,' for the time-less spaces to be defined later.
Accordingly the word 'level' is used here.
</p>
<p>
<b>35.2</b> An indefinite number of non-parallel moments will intersect
each other in the same level, forming their complete intersection;
and one level will never be merely a (logical) part of another
level. Let three mutually intersecting moments
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 15.584ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/164.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{1}, M_{2}, \text{and}\, M_{3}">, say)
intersect in the levels <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 9.397ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/165.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{23}, l_{31}, l_{12}">. Then
three cases can arise: <i>either</i> (i) the levels are all identical
[this will happen if any two are identical], <i>or</i> (ii) no pair of
the levels intersect, <i>or</i> (iii) a pair of the levels, say
<img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.462ex; height: 1.945ex;" src="images/166.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{31}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.462ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/167.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{12}">, intersect. In case (i) the three moments are
called 'co-level.' In case (ii) there are special relations of
parallelism of levels, to be considered later. In case (iii) the locus
of abstractive elements and abstractive classes which forms the
intersection of <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.462ex; height: 1.945ex;" src="images/166.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{31}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.462ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/167.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{12}"> will be called a 'rect'; let
this rect be named <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 3.608ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/168.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{123}">. Then <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 3.608ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/168.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{123}"> is also the complete
intersection of <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.462ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/167.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{12}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.462ex; height: 1.945ex;" src="images/169.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{23}">, and of and <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 2.462ex; height: 1.945ex;" src="images/166.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{31}">, and of
the three moments <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 11.559ex; height: 1.984ex;" src="images/170.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}">. When three moments have a
rect as their complete intersection they are called 'co-rect.' A rect is
an instantaneous straight line in the instantaneous three-dimensional
space of any moment in which it lies. But, as before, the conventional
space-nomenclature is avoided in connection with instantaneous spaces.
</p>
<p>
<b>35.3</b> For four distinct moments there are four possible cases in
respect to their intersection. In case (i) there is no common
intersection: in case (ii) there is a common intersection which is a
level: in case (iii) there is a common intersection which is a rect: in
case (iv) there is a common intersection which is neither a rect nor a
level; in this case the common intersection will be called a 'punct.'
</p>
<p>
Consider four moments <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 15.747ex; height: 1.984ex;" src="images/171.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}, M_{4}"> which constitute an
instance of case (iv). Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.462ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/167.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{12}"> be the level which is the
intersection of <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.182ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.182ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/173.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{2}">, and let be the rect which is
the intersection of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 11.559ex; height: 1.984ex;" src="images/174.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{2}, M_{3}, M_{4}">. Then the rect <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 3.608ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/175.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{234}">
does not lie in the level <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.462ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/167.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{12}">. The rect <img style="vertical-align: -0.375ex; width: 3.608ex; height: 1.375ex;" src="images/175.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{234}"> intersects
the level <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.462ex; height: 1.91ex;" src="images/167.svg" alt=" " data-tex="l_{12}"> in the common intersection of the four moments.
This common intersection is an instantaneous point in the instantaneous
spaces of the moments. In accordance with our practice of avoiding the
conventional spatial terms when speaking of an instantaneous space, we
have called this intersection a 'punct.' Since space is
three-dimensional, any moment either covers every member of a given
punct or covers none of its members. A punct represents the ideal of the
maximum simplicity of absolute position in the instantaneous space of a
moment in which it lies.
</p>
<p>
<b><a id="art35.4">35.4</a></b> It is tempting, on the mathematical
analogy of four-dimensional space, to assert the existence of unlimited
events which may be called the complete intersections of pairs of
non-parallel durations. It is dangerous however blindly to follow
spatial analogies; and I can find no evidence for such unlimited events,
forming the complete intersections of pairs of intersecting durations,
except in the excluded case of parallelism when the complete
intersection (if it exist) is itself a duration. Accordingly, apart from
parallelism, it may be assumed that the events extended over by a pair
of intersecting durations are all finite events. No change in the sequel
is required if the existence of such infinite events be asserted.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art36"><b><i>36. Parallelism and Order</i></b></a>. <b>36.1</b>
Two levels which are the intersections of one moment with two parallel
moments are called 'parallel.' Two parallel levels do not intersect, and
conversely two levels in the same moment which do not intersect are
parallel.
</p>
<p>
In any moment there will be a complete system of levels parallel to a
given level in that moment, and such levels will be parallel to each
other.
</p>
<p>
Similarly 'parallel' rects are defined by the intersection of parallel
levels with a given level, all in one moment. Thus within any moment the
whole theory of euclidean parallelism (so far as it is non-metrical)
follows, and need not be further elaborated except to note the existence
of parallelograms.
</p>
<p>
<b>36.2</b> The definitions of parallel levels and of parallel rects can
be extended to include levels and rects which are not co-momental:

</p>
<p>
A moment and a rect which do not intersect are parallel. A rect either
intersects a moment in one punct, or is parallel to it, or is contained
in it.
</p>
<p>
<b>36.3</b> The essential characteristic of space is bound up in what
may be termed the 'repetition property' of parallelism. This repetition
property is an essential element in congruence as will be seen later;
also the homogeneity of space depends on it. Examples of the repetition
property are as follows: if a rect intersects any moment in one and only
one punct, then it intersects each moment of that time-system in one and
only one punct: if a level intersects any moment in one and only one
rect, then it intersects any moment of that time-system in one and only
one rect. But we must not apply the theory of repetition in parallelism
mechanically without attention to the nature of the property concerned.
For example, if a rect is incident in a moment, it does not intersect
any other moment of the same time-system, and therefore <i>à
fortiori</i> is not incident in any of them; and analogously for a level
incident in a moment.
</p>
<p>
<b>36.4</b> Puncts on a rect have an order which is derivative from the
order of moments in a time-system and which connects the orders of
various time-systems. The puncts on any given rect <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> will
respectively be incident in the moments of any time-system <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> to
which the rect is not parallel. Any moment of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> will contain
one punct of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">, and any punct of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> will lie in one moment of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">. Thus the puncts of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> have derivatively the order of the
moments of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">. Again let <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> be another such time-system.
Then the puncts of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> have derivatively the order of the moments of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">. But it is found that these two orders for puncts on <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> are
identical, namely there is only one order for the puncts on <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> to be
obtained in this way. By means of these puncts on rects the orders of
moments of different time-systems are correlated. Thus the existence of
order in the instantaneous spaces of moments is explained; but the
theory of congruence has not yet been entered upon.
</p>
<p>
<b>36.5</b> The set of puncts, rects and levels in any one moment thus
form a complete three-dimensional euclidean geometry, of which the
meaning of the metrical properties has not yet been investigated. It is
no necessary here to enunciate the fundamental propositions [such as two
puncts defining a rect, and so on] from which the whole theory can be
deduced so far as metrical relations are not concerned.

FINITE ABSTRACTIVE ELEMENTS</h2>

<p>
<a id="art37"><b><i>37. Absolute Primes and Event-Particles</i></b></a>.
<b>37.1</b> It follows from the principles of convergence to simplicity
with diminution of extent that, for exhibiting the relations between
events in their utmost simplicity, abstractive elements of minimum
complexity are required, that is, elements which converge towards the
ideal of an atomic event. This requisite exacts that the formative
condition from which the 'atomic' element is deduced should be such as
to impose the minimum of restriction on convergence.
</p>
<p>
<b>37.2</b> An abstractive class which is prime in respect to the
formative condition of 'covering all the elements and abstractive
classes constituting some assigned punct' is called an 'absolute prime.'
</p>
<p>
Evidently the condition satisfied by an absolute prime is regular for
primes. The abstractive element deduced from an absolute prime is called
an 'event-particle.' An event-particle is the route of approximation to
an atomic event, which is an ideal satisfied by no actual event.
</p>
<p>
An abstractive class which is antiprime in respect to the formative
condition of 'being a member of some assigned punct' is evidently an
absolute prime. In fact this set of antiprimes is identical with the set
of absolute primes.
</p>
<p>
An event-particle is an instantaneous point viewed in the guise of an
atomic event. The punct which an event-particle covers gives it an
absolute position in the instantaneous space of any moment in which it
lies. Event-particles on a rect lie in the order derived from the puncts
which they cover.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art37.3"><b>37.3</b></a> The complete set of event-particles
inhering in an event will be called the set 'analysing' that event. A
set of event-particles can only analyse one event, and an event can be
analysed by only one set of event-particles.
</p>
<p>
An event-particle 'bounds' an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/133.svg" alt=" " data-tex="x"> when every event in which the

'boundary' of that event. A boundary can only bound one event and every
event has a boundary.
</p>
<p>
Event-particles which neither inhere in an event nor bound it are said

The existence of boundaries enables the contact of events to be defined,
namely, events are in 'contact' when their boundaries have one or more
event-particles in common. The adjunction of events implies contact but
not vice versa; since adjunction requires that a solid of the boundaries
should be in common. But we define the notion of solid by means of that
of adjunction, and not conversely.

<b>37.5</b> The fact that the instantaneous geometry within a moment is
three-dimensional leads to the conclusion that the geometry for all
event-particles will be four-dimensional. It is to be noted however that
the straight lines for this four-dimensional geometry have so far only
been defined for event-particles which are co-momental, namely the
rects. Event-particles which are not co-momental will be called

A 'simple' abstractive class is an abstractive class for which there is
no one event-particle on the boundaries of all those members of the
converging end, which succeed some given member of the class; namely,
for a simple abstractive class there is no one event-particle at which
all members of the converging end have contact.
</p>
<p>
Absolute antiprimes and absolute primes are simple abstractive classes.
The 'atomic' property of an absolute prime is expressed by the theorem,
that an absolute prime is a simple abstractive class which is covered by
every simple abstractive class which it covers. The property of
'instantaneous completeness' exhibited by an absolute antiprime is
expressed by the theorem, that an absolute antiprime is an abstractive
class which covers every abstractive class that covers it.

linear abstractive class converges to an element of higher complexity
than an event-particle; and the condition (ii) secures that it has the
linear type of continuity.

<p>
A 'linear prime' is an abstractive class which is prime in respect to
the formative condition of (i) being covered by an assigned linear
abstractive class covering two assigned end-points and (ii) being itself
a linear abstractive class covering the same assigned end-points. This
formative condition is evidently regular for primes.

<p>
A 'route' is the abstractive element deduced from a linear prime. The
two assigned event-particles which occur as end-points in the definition
of the linear prime from which a route is deduced are called the
'end-points' of that route. A route is said to lie between its
end-points.
</p>
<p>
<b>38.2</b> A route is a linear segment, straight or curved, between two
event-particles, co-momental or sequent. There are an indefinite number
of routes between a given pair of event-particles as end-points. A route

end-points. The continuity of events issues in a theory of the
continuity of routes.

The particles on any route are arranged in a continuous serial order by
his relation of 'lying between' holding for triads of points on it. The
necessary and sufficient conditions which the relation must satisfy
to produce this serial order are detailed in (iv) of
<a href="#art34.3">34.3</a>.

<p>
<b>38.3</b> A route may, or may not, be covered by a moment. If it is so
covered it is called a 'co-momental route.' A 'rectilinear route' is a
route such that all the event-particles which it covers lie on a rect.
In a rectilinear route the order of the event-particles on the rect
agrees with the order of the event-particles as defined by the relation
of 'lying between' as defined for the route.
</p>
<p>
Between any two event-particles on a rect there is one and only one
rectilinear route. If <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="B"> be two event-particles on a rect,

<p>
<b>38.4</b> Among the routes which are not co-momental, the important

end-points, covers one and only one event-particle on the route, and
(iii) all the event-particles of the route are so covered.

The event-particles covered by a kinematic route represent a possible
path for a 'material particle.' But this anticipates later developments
of the subject, since the concept of a 'material particle' has not yet
been defined.

solid prime.

<b>39.2</b> If two event-particles are covered by a solid, there are an

A solid which is not co-momental is called 'vagrant.' The properties of
vagrant solids are assuming importance in connection with Einstein's
theory of gravitation; the consideration of these properties is not
undertaken in this enquiry. Co-momental solids are also called
'volumes.' Volumes are capable of a simpler definition which is given in
the next article.

<b>40.2</b> Any volume is covered by the assigned moment of which
mention occurs in its definition. Thus every volume (as here defined) is
co-momental. Also a volume only covers those event-particles of which
mention occurs in its definition. This set of event-particles is
completely characteristic of the volume, and may be considered as the
volume conceived as a locus of event-particles.
</p>
<p>
In exactly the same way a solid, or a route, is completely defined by
the event-particles which it covers and vice versa. Thus solids and
routes can be conceived as loci of event-particles.
</p>
<p>
The concrete event itself is also defined by (or, analysed by) the
event-particles inhering in it, and such a set of event-particles
defines only one event. Thus an event can be looked on as a locus of
event-particles. An event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">′ which is part of an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> is
defined in this way by a set of event-particles which are some of the
set defining <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">. This fact is the reason for the confusion of the
logical 'all' and 'some' with the physical 'whole' and 'part' which
apply solely to events. An event is also uniquely defined by the set of
event-particles which form its boundary.

Every station is a route; and also every station in a duration
intersects every moment of that duration [i.e. inherent in it] in one

the same sense of 'here' as for every other event-particle in that

<p>
Each event-particle is contained in one and only one point of each
time-system, and will be said to 'occupy' such a point. Two points of
the same time-system never intersect; two point-tracks which are
respectively points in the spaces of different time-systems either do
not intersect or intersect in one event-particle only.
</p>
<p>
Since each point-track intersects any moment in one and only one
event-particle, two co-momental event-particles cannot lie on the same
point-track. A pair of sequent event-particles lie in one and only one
point-track, apart from exceptional cases when they lie in
'null-tracks.' Null-tracks are introduced later in
<a href="#art45">article 45</a>.


</p>
<p>
<b>42.4</b> In the four-dimensional geometry of event-particles it has
already been pointed out that rects have the character of straight
lines, but that since sequent event-particles do not lie on the same
rect there is a missing set of straight lines required to complete the
geometry. Point-tracks [together with the exceptional set of loci termed
'null-tracks'] form this missing set of straight lines for this geometry
of event-particles.
</p>
<p>
The event-particles occupying a point-track have an order derived from
the covering moments of any time-system. Those on a null-track have an
order derived from routes which it is not necessary to discuss.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art43"><b><i>43. Parallelism</i></b></a>. <b>43.1</b> A theory of
parallelism holds for point-tracks and can be connected with the
analogous theory for rects. Point-tracks which are points in the space
of the same time-system are called 'parallel.' Thus a complete family of
parallel point-tracks is merely a complete family of points in the space
of some time-system. The parallelism of point-tracks is evidently
transitive, symmetrical and reflexive. The definition of the parallelism
of stations is derived from that of point-tracks.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art43.2"><b>43.2</b></a> The parallelism of point-tracks and the
parallelism of rects and moments are interconnected. Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> be any

<p>
This theorem, the theorems of <a href="#art43.2">43.2</a> and the
corresponding theorem for two families of parallel rects are examples of
the repetition property of parallelism. It is evident that, given any
three event-particles not on one rect or one point-track, a
parallelogram can be completed of which the three event-particles are
three corners, any one of the event-particles being at the junction of
the adjacent sides through the three corners. In such a parallelogram
opposite sides are always of the same denomination, namely both rects or
both point-tracks; but adjacent sides may be of opposite denominations.

by point-tracks.
</p>
<p>
The loci which bound the regions separating point-tracks from rects will
be called 'null-tracks.' Their special properties will be considered
later when congruence has been introduced. In any matrix there are two
families of parallel null-tracks; and there is one member of each family
passing through each event-particle on the rectilinear track. The order
of event-particles on a null-track is derived from its intersection with
systems of parallel rects [not co-momental] or of parallel point-tracks
or from the orders on routes lying on it.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art46"><b><i>46. Straight Lines</i></b></a>. <b>46.1</b> There is
evidently an important theory of parallelism for families of matrices
analogous to the theory of parallels for families of levels. The
detailed properties need not be elaborated here.
</p>
<p>
Two matrices may either (i) be parallel, or (ii) intersect in one
event-particle only, or (iii) intersect in a rect, or (iv) intersect in
a point-track, or (v) intersect in a null-track. For the intersection of
two levels only cases (i), (ii) and (iii) can occur; for the
intersection of a level and a matrix only cases (ii) and (iii) can
occur.
</p>
<p>
<b>46.2</b> Each matrix contains various sets of parallel point-tracks.
Any one such set is a locus of points in the space of some time-system.
Such a locus of points is called a 'straight line' in the space of the
time-system.
</p>
<p>
A matrix which contains the points of a straight line in the space of
any time-system <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> will be called 'an associated matrix for
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">,' and it is called 'the matrix including' that straight line.
</p>
<p>
A matrix is an associated matrix for many time-systems, but it is the
matrix including only one straight line in each corresponding space. The
family of time-systems for which a given matrix is an associated matrix
is called a 'collinear' family. A whole family of parallel matrices are
associated matrices for the same collinear family of time-systems, if
any one matrix of the family is thus associated. In the space of any one
time-system the straight lines included by a family of parallel
associated matrices are said to be parallel.
</p>
<p>
<b>46.3</b> A matrix intersects a moment in a rect. If the moment belong
to a time-system with which the matrix is associated, this rect in the
moment corresponds to the straight line included by the matrix in the
sense that it has one particle occupying each of its points. A rect thus
associated with a straight line will be said to 'occupy' it.
</p>
<p>
Thus the event-particles on a matrix <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/33.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> associated with a time-system
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> can be exhaustively grouped into mutually exclusive subsets
in two distinct ways: (i)They can be grouped into the points of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> which lie on <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/33.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m">; this locus of points is the included
straight line in the space of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, which we will name
<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.198ex; height: 1.357ex;" src="images/204.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m_{\alpha}">: (ii) The event-particles on <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/33.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> can be grouped into
the sets of parallel rects which are the intersections of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/33.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> with the
moments of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, and thus each of these rects occupies
<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.198ex; height: 1.357ex;" src="images/204.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m_{\alpha}">.
</p>
<p>
<b>46.4</b> There are three different types of meaning which can be
given to the idea of 'space' in connection with external nature, (i)
There is the four-dimensional space of which event-particles are the
points and the rects and point-tracks and null-tracks are the straight
lines. In the geometry of this space there is a lack of uniformity
between the congruence theories for rects and for point-tracks, and no
such theory for null-tracks, (ii) There are the three-dimensional
momentary (instantaneous) spaces in the moments of any time-system
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, of which event-particles are the points and rects are the
straight lines. The observed space of ordinary perception is an
approximation to this exact concept, (iii) There is the time-less
three-dimensional space of the time-system <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, of which
point-tracks are the points and matrices include the straight lines.
This is the space of physical science.
</p>
<p>
There is an exact correlation between the time-less space of a
time-system and any momentary space of the same time-system. For any
point of the momentary space is an event-particle which occupies one and
only one point of the time-less space; and any straight line of the
momentary space is a rect which lies in one associated matrix including
one straight line of the time-less space, or (in other words) each
straight line of the momentary space occupies a straight line of the
time-less space.
</p>
<p>
A time-system corresponds to a consentient set of the Newtonian group,
and the time-less space of the time-system is the space of the
corresponding consentient group.

<p>
<a id="art48"><b><i>48. Congruence</i></b></a>. <a
id="art48.1"><b>48.1</b></a> Congruence is founded on the notion of
repetition, namely in some sense congruent geometric elements repeat
each other. Repetition embodies the principle of uniformity. Now we have
found repetition to be a leading characteristic of parallelism;
accordingly a close connection may be divined to exist between
congruence and parallelism. Furthermore we have just elaborated in
outline the principles of normality, pointing out how the property has
its origin in the interplay of the relations of extension and
cogredience. But&mdash;as we know from experience&mdash;a leading
property of normality is symmetry, namely, symmetry round the normal.
Now symmetry is merely another name for a certain sort of repetition;
accordingly congruence and normality should be connected.
</p>
<p>
We are thus led to look for an expression of the nature of congruence in
terms of parallelism and normality, in particular in terms of repetition
properties associated with them.
</p>
<p>
<b>48.2</b> Congruence, in so far as it is derived from parallelism, is
defined by the statements that (i) the opposite sides of parallelograms
are congruent to each other, and (ii) routes on the same rect, or on the
same point-track, which are congruent to the same route are
congruent to each other<a id="FNanchor_7_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.
</p>
<p>
Also the general law holds that two routes which (as thus defined) are
congruent to a third route, are congruent to each other. This law is a
substantial theorem as to parallelism, and not a mere consequence of
definitions.
</p>
<p>
But congruence, as thus expressed in terms of parallelism, merely
establishes the congruent relation among straight routes on rects
belonging to one parallel family, or on point-tracks belonging to one
parallel family. For such routes in any one parallel family a system of
numerical measurement can be established, of which the details need not
be here elaborated. But no principle of comparison has yet been
established between the lengths of two routes belonging to different
parallel families of rects or belonging to different parallel families
of point-tracks. When we can determine equal lengths on any two rects,
whether parallel or no, the general principles for space-measurement
will have been determined; and when we can determine equal lapses [i.e.
lengths] of time on any two point-tracks, whether parallel or no, the

<a id="art48.3"><b>48.3</b></a> Congruence as between different parallel
families results from the following definition founded on the repetition
property [i.e. symmetry] of normality : Let <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 4.075ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/214.svg" alt=" " data-tex="AM"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.437ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/215.svg" alt=" " data-tex="BC"> be a pair
of mutually normal rects intersecting at <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.378ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/190.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M">, or be a rect and
point-track intersecting at <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.378ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/190.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M"> [either <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 4.075ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/214.svg" alt=" " data-tex="AM"> or <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.437ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/215.svg" alt=" " data-tex="BC"> being the
rect] and mutually normal, and let <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.378ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/190.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M"> be the middle event-particle of
the straight route <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.437ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/215.svg" alt=" " data-tex="BC"> intervening between the event-particles <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="B">
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.719ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/161.svg" alt=" " data-tex="C">, then the straight routes <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 3.414ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/156.svg" alt=" " data-tex="AB"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 1.67ex;" src="images/216.svg" alt=" " data-tex="AC"> are congruent to
each other.
</p>
<p>
From the symmetry of normality either both pairs of particles, namely
(<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 4.42ex; height: 2.059ex;" src="images/217.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A, B">) and (<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 4.422ex; height: 2.059ex;" src="images/218.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A, C">), are joined by rects, or both pairs are joined
by point-tracks, or both pairs by null-tracks. As in the analogous case
of congruence derived from parallelism, the transitiveness of congruence
expresses a substantial law of nature and not a mere deduction from the
terms of the definition.

<a id="art48.4"><b>48.4</b></a> The isosceles triangle of
<a href="#art48.3">48.3</a> must lie either on a level or on a matrix. If
it lies on a level, all the straight routes of the figure must lie on
rects. But on a matrix a pair of normals cannot be of the same
denomination, i.e. not both rects nor both point-tracks. Thus five cases
remain over for consideration. These cases are diagrammatically
symbolised by the annexed figures where continuous lines represent
rects, and dotted lines represent point-tracks.

<a id="art48.5"><b>48.5</b></a> Case (i) of <a href="#art48.4">48.4</a>
enables us to complete the congruence theory for spatial measurements.
Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/219.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/220.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{2}"> be any two co-momental rects intersecting in
the event-particle <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A">.

let <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/220.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{2}">′ be the rect through <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.717ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="B"> parallel to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/220.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{2}">.
</p>
<p>
Now assume that it is possible to find one pair of mutually normal
rects, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">′ intersecting each other at <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A">, and

<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.719ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/161.svg" alt=" " data-tex="C">″.
</p>
<p>
Then from <a href="#art48.1">48.1</a>, <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 11.89ex; height: 1.805ex;" src="images/222.svg" alt=" " data-tex="AC″ = BD′"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 10.646ex; height: 1.805ex;" src="images/223.svg" alt=" " data-tex="AC′ = BD">.
Thus <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.719ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/161.svg" alt=" " data-tex="C">′ and <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.719ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/161.svg" alt=" " data-tex="C">″ denote the same event-particle. Now
<img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 11.832ex; height: 1.781ex;" src="images/224.svg" alt=" " data-tex="BM = MC′">. Hence by case (i) of <a href="#art48.4">48.4</a>,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 10.47ex; height: 1.805ex;" src="images/225.svg" alt=" " data-tex="AB = AC′">. Thus lengths on <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/219.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/220.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{2}"> are comparable. We
need not here consider the theorems, either assumed as independent laws of
nature or deduced from previous assumptions, by which we know that the
rectangular pair (<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">′) exist, that <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.719ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/161.svg" alt=" " data-tex="C">′ and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.719ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/161.svg" alt=" " data-tex="C">″ coincide and do not lie on opposite sides of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A">,
and that <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 11.832ex; height: 1.781ex;" src="images/224.svg" alt=" " data-tex="BM = MC′">.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art48.6"><b>48.6</b></a> Again if <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/219.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/220.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{2}"> are
rects which are not comomental and do not lie in parallel moments, their
measurements are still comparable. For two intersecting moments,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.182ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.182ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/173.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{2}">, exist, of which <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.182ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{1}"> contains <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/219.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{1}">
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.182ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/173.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{2}"> contains <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/220.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{2}">.

<p class="nind">
Thus any rect <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">′ in the level common to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.182ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 3.182ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/172.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{1}"> has
its measurements comparable both to those on <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/219.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{1}"> and to those on
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/220.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{2}">; and thus, by the transitiveness of congruence, the
measurements on <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/219.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{1}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.008ex; height: 1.339ex;" src="images/220.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{2}"> are comparable. By
this procedure the employment of cases (ii) and (iii) of
<a href="#art48.4">48.4</a> is rendered unnecessary. Accordingly these
cases become theorems instead of being definitions of congruence as
contemplated in their original enunciation. If they had been taken as
definitions, the deduction of <a href="#art48.5">48.5</a> would still be
possible. But since the figure would now lie in a matrix, one of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">′ would be a point-track and the other a rect. No very obvious
principle then exists by which we could know of the existence of the
pair (<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">′) such that <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 10.82ex; height: 1.731ex;" src="images/226.svg" alt=" " data-tex="DB =BD′"> apart from the assumption
of the theorem which we want to prove.
</p>
<p>
<b>48.7</b> Cases (iv) and (v) of <a href="#art48.4">48.4</a> deal with
the comparability of time-measurements in different time-systems. The
same remarks as those in <a href="#art48.6">48.6</a> apply; namely that
the method of <a href="#art48.5">48.5</a> could be applied, if
independently we could convince ourselves that the requisite pair, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/177.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">′ (one a point-track and one a rect), exist.
</p>
<p>
This comparability of time-measurements will be achieved by another
method which depends on the fact that relative velocity is equal and
opposite. The explanation of this method must be reserved for the next
chapter.

A moment, viewed as a locus of event-particles, is represented
by a linear equation in the four coordinates

But the converse is not true; namely, not every linear equation
represents a moment. A pair of linear equations represent a level or
a matrix, and three independent linear equations represent a rect or a
point-track or a null-track.

<a href="#art45.2">subarticle 45.2</a> it will be seen that, of the four
angular regions into which the rects <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 5.579ex; height: 1.95ex;" src="images/229.svg" alt=" " data-tex="OO_{\alpha x}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 5.461ex; height: 2.242ex;" src="images/253.svg" alt=" " data-tex="OO_{\beta x}">
divide the matrix <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 4.421ex; height: 2.242ex;" src="images/251.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{\alpha\beta t}">, two vertically opposite regions
include no point-tracks passing through <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> and the remaining two such
regions include point-tracks as well as rects through <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">. The standard
choice of positive directions for <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 5.579ex; height: 1.95ex;" src="images/229.svg" alt=" " data-tex="OO_{\alpha x}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 5.461ex; height: 2.242ex;" src="images/253.svg" alt=" " data-tex="OO_{\beta x}"> is
such that the two regions bounded one by both positive directions of
these axes, and the other by both negative directions, should include
only rects passing through <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">.
</p>
<p>
The positive directions for <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 5.242ex; height: 1.95ex;" src="images/228.svg" alt=" " data-tex="OO_{\alpha t}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 5.123ex; height: 2.242ex;" src="images/252.svg" alt=" " data-tex="OO_{\beta t}"> are
settled by the rule that a positive measure of lapse of time should
indicate subsequence in the time-order to the moment <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.938ex; height: 1.95ex;" src="images/89.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O_{\alpha}">.
This rule is definite because of the ultimate distinction between
antecedence and subsequence in time, which has not otherwise been made
use of. This standard choice of positive directions along mutual axes
for two time-systems will always be adopted.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art50.3"><b>50.3</b></a> The principle of kinematic symmetry has
two parts, enunciating consequences which flow from the fact that the
time-units in two time-systems <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> are congruent.
The first part may be taken as the definition, or necessary and
sufficient test, of such congruence.
</p>
<p>
The first part of the principle can be enunciated as the statement that
the measures of relative velocities [i.e. the velocity of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> in

V_{\alpha\beta} + V_{\beta\alpha} = 0
\qquad\text{(i)}.
"></span>
</p>
<p>
The second part is the principle of the symmetry of two time-systems in
respect to transverse velocities; namely, if a velocity <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.735ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/289.svg" alt=" " data-tex="U"> in
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, normally transverse to the direction of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta"> in

From the first part of the principle, by (ii) and (iii) of

In order to apply the second part of the principle we first identify

in every other time-system. No assumption of the existence of a velocity
with this property or of the electromagnetic invariance has entered into
the deduction of the kinematic equations of the hyperbolic type. A
velocity greater than <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> cannot represent any time-system, and
accordingly its physical significance must be entirely different from
that of a velocity less than <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c">.

</p>
<p>
In the framing of physical laws it is essential to consider what measure
of separation is relevant. It is to be noted that there may be
time-systems <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> (other than <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.29ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/191.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\pi">) of special relevance to the
phenomena in question. It is not at all obvious that invariance of form
in respect to all time-systems is a requisite in the complete expression
of such laws; namely, the demand for relativistic equations is only of
limited applicability.

A correlation of time-systems to event-particles which is one-many, so

The fundamental distinction between space and time, i.e. between rects
and point-tracks, has failed to find any expression in the formulae for
measurement relations. Accordingly with this type of kinematics, it
would be natural to suppose that the distinction does not exist and that
every rect was a point-track and every point-track a rect. This
conception is logically possible but does not appear to correspond to
the properties of the external world of events as we know it.
Furthermore the electromagnetic equations lose their invariant property.
</p>
<p>
Altogether there appear to be good reasons for putting aside the
elliptic type of kinematics as inapplicable to nature.

These are the formulae for the ordinary Newtonian relativity.
</p>
<p>
These formulae are well in accordance with common sense and are in fact
the formulae naturally suggested by ordinary experience. To some extent
the hyperbolic formulae lead to unexpected results, though, if <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> be
a velocity not less than that of light, the divergences from the
deliverances of common sense take place in respect to phenomena which
are not manifest in ordinary experience. But when by refined methods of
observation the divergences between the two types of kinematics should
be apparent to the senses, experiment has, so far, pronounced in favour
of the hyperbolic type. Accordingly it is this type which we consider in
the sequel.
</p>
<p>
<b>52.9</b> There is however one objection to the hyperbolic type, as
compared to the parabolic type, which is worth considering. In the
hyperbolic kinematics there is an absolute velocity <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> with special
properties in nature. The difficulty which is thus occasioned is rather
an offence to philosophic instincts than a logical puzzle. But certainly
our familiar experience, in some way which it is difficult to formulate
in words, leads us to shun the introduction of such absolute physical
quantities. This particular difficulty is largely diminished by noting
that the existence of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> with its peculiar properties really means
that the space-units and time-units are comparable; namely, there is a
natural relation between them to be expressed by taking <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> to be
unity. Either the time-unit would then be inconveniently small or the
space-unit inconveniently large; but this inconvenience does not alter
the fact that congruence between time and space is definable. Always
when a possible definition of congruence is omitted, such absolute
physical quantities occur. The fact that, so far as time and space are
concerned, the existence of a congruence theory seems paradoxical is due
to absence of any phenomena depending on that theory except in very
exceptional circumstances produced by refined observations.

distinct from that of being situated in an event, though the two
concepts are closely allied by a determinate connection. The notion of
the situation of an object is logically indefinable being one of the
ultimate data of science; the notion of the location of an object is
definable in terms of the notion of its situation.
</p>
<p>
An object is said to be 'located' in an abstractive element if there is
a simple abstractive class 'converging' to the element and such that
each of its members is a situation of the object.
</p>
<p>
In general when an object is located in an abstractive element there
will be many simple abstractive classes converging to the element and
such that each of their members is a situation of the object. In any
specific case of location usually all abstractive classes of a certain
type will possess the required property.
</p>
<p>
It follows from this definition that, in the primary signification of
location, an object is located in an element of instantaneous space. The
notion of location in an element of time-less space follows derivatively
by correlating the elements of instantaneous space to the elements of
time-less space in the way already described. In our immediate thoughts
which follow perception we make a jump from the situation of an object
within the short specious present to its location in instantaneous
space, and thence by further reflexion to its location in time-less
space. Thus location in space is always an ideal of thought and never a
fact of perception. An object may be located in a volume, an area, a
route, or an event-particle of instantaneous space, and thence
derivatively it will be located in a volume, or an area, or a segment,
or a point of timeless space.
</p>
<p>
<b>53.2</b> In considering the scientific object it is the occupied
event which corresponds to the situation of the physical object. The
occupied event is the situation of the charge, in so far as the single
scientific object is conceived as an (ideal) physical object.
</p>
<p>
<b>53.3</b> There are evidently many different kinds of location which
satisfy the general definition of location in an abstractive element,
even when the kind of abstractive element is assigned. These differences
mainly arise from differences in the relations of objects to parts of
their situations. An object is an atomic entity and as such is related
to its situations. But a situation is an event with parts of various
kinds, and we have to consider the various kinds of relationships which
objects may have to various kinds of parts of their situations.
</p>
<p>
For example, if the sense-object 'redness, of a definite shade' be
located in an area, it will be located in any portion of that area; and
this arises from the fact that if it be situated in an event, it is also
situated in any portion of that event. But it is not true that if a
chair be situated in an event, that the chair&mdash;as one atomic
object&mdash;is situated in any part of the event though it is so
situated in some parts. Again a tune cannot be situated in any event
comprised in a duration too short for the successive notes to be
sounded. Thus for a tune a minimum quantum of time is necessary.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art54"><b><i>54. Uniform Objects</i></b></a>. <b>54.1</b> It will
be convenient to classify objects according as they do or do not satisfy
certain important conditions respecting their relations to their
situations.
</p>
<p>
'Uniform' objects are objects with a certain smoothness in their
temporal relations, so that they require no minimum quantum of
time-lapse in the events which are their situations. These are objects
which can be said to exist 'at a given moment.' For example, a tune is
not an uniform object; but a chair, as ordinarily recognised, is such an
object. The example of the chair, and the dissolution of its continuous
materials with specific physical constants into assemblages of
electrons, warn us that a problem remains over for discussion after we
shall have defined the meaning to be assigned to 'uniformity.'
</p>
<p>
<b>54.2</b> In order to explain more precisely the theory of uniform
objects, it is convenient to make a few definitions:
</p>
<p>
A 'slice' of an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> in a time-system <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> is that part of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> lying between two moments of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, where both moments
intersect <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">. The two moments are called the terminal moments of the
slice, and the volumes in which the terminal moments intersect <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> are
called the terminal volumes. For brevity a slice of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> in the
time-system <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> is called an '<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-slice of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">.'
</p>
<p>
It follows from the continuity of events that any <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-moment
lying between the terminal moments of an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-slice of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">
intersects <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> in a volume. Such a volume is called an
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-section of the slice. A slice is itself an event which
stretches throughout the duration bounded by its terminal moments. Thus
if the duration be the specious present for some percipient, the slice
of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> is the part of the event e which falls within that specious
present.
</p>
<p>
<b>54.3</b> The properties of uniform objects will be enunciated as a set
of laws regulating their character.
</p>
<p>
Law I. If <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> be any time-system and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> be a situation of an
uniform object <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">, then an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-slice of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> exists which
is a situation of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">.
</p>
<p>
Law II. If <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> be any time-system and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.971ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/136.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b"> be a situation
of an uniform object <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">′ be an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-slice of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> which
is a situation of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">, then every <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-slice of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">′ is a
situation of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">.
</p>
<p>
Law I can roughly be construed as meaning that if an uniform object
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> has been situated in any event, then there is some period of time
(in any time-system) during which it has existed; and in the same way
Law II means that if an uniform object has existed during any period of
time, then it has existed during any shorter period within that period.
These laws are obvious as applied to uniform objects, but not so obvious
for objects in general, as 'object' is here defined. For example a
musical note cannot exist in a period of time shorter than its period of
vibration, and a percipient whose specious present was too short could
not hear it. It follows from law II that if an uniform object O is
situated in an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">′ be an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-slice of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">
which is a situation of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">, then an abstractive class of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-slices converging to any <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-section of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">′ can be
found such that <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> is situated in each member of the class. Hence
evidently <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> is located in every <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-section of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">′. This
is the conception of an uniform object being located in a spatial volume
at a durationless moment of time.
</p>
<p>
With certain explanations and limitations laws I and II apply to many
types of objects. In fact it requires an effort to realise that there
are cases to which they do not apply. They have been stated above in the
most formal manner to exhibit the fact that, when they do apply, they
are empirical laws of nature and not <i>à priori</i> logical truths.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art55"><b><i>55. Components of Objects</i></b></a>. <b>55.1</b>
The concept of a 'component' of a main object is difficult to make
precise. A component of an object <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> is another distinct object
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">′ such that (i) whenever <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> is situated in an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">, there
is an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">′, which is either <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> itself or a part of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">, in
which <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">′ is situated, and (ii) <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">′ may also be situated in an
event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">″ which is not a situation of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> or any part
of a situation of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">.
</p>
<p>
Thus a component is necessary to the main object, but the main object is
not necessary to the component. For example, a certain note may be
necessary for a certain tune, but the note can be sounded without the
tune. The main object requires its component, but the component does not
require the main object.
</p>
<p>
But this general idea of a component is not of great importance apart
from further specialisation. There are many such specialisations; but in
science there are three which are of peculiar importance, namely,
'concurrent components,' 'extensive components' and 'causal components.'
</p>
<p>
<b>55.2</b> An object <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">′ is a 'concurrent' component of an object
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> when it is a component of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">, and if <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> be any situation of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">, there is an event <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e">′ which is part of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> and is such that
(i) it is a situation of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">′ and (ii) it is cut in a slice which is a
situation of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">′ by any duration which cuts <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> in a slice which is
a situation of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">.
</p>
<p>
Thus a concurrent component lasts concurrently with the main object in
any time-system.

MATERIAL OBJECTS</h2>

<p>
<a id="art56"><b><i>56. Material Objects</i></b></a>. <b>56.1</b> A
material object is essentially a material object of a certain definite
sort; namely, we define sorts of material objects, which are sets of
objects with certain definite peculiarities, and a material object is
such because it is a member of one of these sorts. For example a piece
of wood is a material object because it belongs to the class of wooden
objects and because this class possesses the requisite peculiarities.
Similarly a charge of electricity is a material object for an analogous
reason.
</p>
<p>
The objects which compose a set (<img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.364ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/382.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\mu">) form a sort of 'material'

<b>56.3</b> It is by means of the properties of material objects that
the atomic properties of objects are combined in mathematical
calculations with the extensive continuity of events. Apart from
material objects mathematical physics as at present developed would be
impossible. For example where the physicist sees the electron as an
atomic whole, the mathematician sees a distribution of electricity
continuous in time and in space and capable of division into component
objects which are also analogous distributions.

the whole sphere is not the sum of the electromagnetic masses of these

Then it is easily proved that

Now the condition that the total extensive quantity which is the
'charge' of any extensive component never varies when conceived as

</p>
<p>
This is the well-known equation of continuity. Now equation (4) shows
that if this equation holds for the space of any time-system, it holds
for the spaces of all time-systems.
</p>
<p>
When the equation of continuity holds, the 'charge' of any extensive
component of the material object under consideration never varies. Hence
it is a mere matter of words and definition whether the charge is said
to be mediately possessed by the object or immediately possessed.

CAUSAL COMPONENTS</h2>

<p>
<a id="art60"><b><i>60. Apparent and Carnal Characters</i></b></a>.
<b>60.1</b> Are there any material objects in nature? That there are
such bodies is certainly an assumption habitually made in the
applications of mathematics. But the assumption does not supersede the
necessity for enquiry.
</p>
<p>
We may roughly summarise the properties of material objects, as here
defined, by saying that they should be continuous both in time and in
space. But this is just what ordinary perceptual objects appear to be.
Now perceptual objects are what they appear to be; for a perceptual
object is nothing else than the permanent property of its situations,
that they all shall exhibit those appearances. Accordingly if a
perceptual object appears to be a material object, it is a material
object.
</p>
<p>
Now here a difficulty arises; for we all know that, according to
Dalton's atomic theory of chemistry, any apparently continuous substance
is a discrete collection of molecules, and that furthermore, according
to the more recent theories, a molecule is a discrete collection of
electric charges. Accordingly, as we are told, if we could take the
minutest drop of water and magnify it, the phenomena would be analogous
to those of a swarm of flies in a room.
</p>
<p>
It would appear therefore that we are mistaken in classifying a drop
of water as being a material object.
</p>
<p>
<b>60.2</b> The position that we seem to have arrived at is that on the
one hand a drop of water is a material object, because it appears to be
one and it is whatever it appears to be, and that on the other hand it
is really something quite different.
</p>
<p>
Such paradoxes mean that vital distinctions have been overlooked. We
must distinguish between the drop of water as it appears, the event
which is its situation, and the character of the event which causes the
event to present that appearance. Namely, there is the appearance of the
drop of water. This is character No. 1 of the event, the apparent
character, and is a material object. Again there is the character of the
event which is the cause of character No. 1. This is character No. 2 of
the event and is its causal character. According to the doctrine of
science, character No. 2 is not a material object.
</p>
<p>
<b>60.3</b> But why trouble about causal characters? What has pushed
science into their consideration? The impelling reason is the complex
bewildering relationships of the apparent characters. Apparent
characters essentially involve reference to percipient events, and may
be very trivial qualities of the events which they characterise. For
example, all delusive perceptual objects are apparent characters of
events.
</p>
<p>
In the case of a delusive perceptual object character No. 2 of its
situation has no existence, except so far as the event is necessarily
still a 'passive condition' according to the nomenclature of
<a href="#chap07">Chapter VII</a> of Part II. The
active conditioning events for a delusive perceptual object must be
sought elsewhere than in its situation. Let us confine ourselves to the
consideration of non-delusive perceptual objects, that is, to physical
objects.
</p>
<p>
<b>60.4</b> But the line of separation between delusive and non-delusive
perceptual objects is not quite so clear as we might wish. The
definition of delusiveness and non-delusiveness is sufficiently obvious,
namely, a perceptual object is non-delusive when it is the apparent
character of an event which is itself an active condition for the
appearance of that character as perceptible from all percipient events.
In the nomenclature of <a href="#chap07">Chapter VII</a> of Part II the
situation of a physical object is its 'generating event.'
</p>
<p>
Now if this definition is to be taken to the foot of the letter, all
perceptual objects are delusive; for all perception is belated. The sun
which we see is the apparent character of an event simultaneous with our
percipient event, and this event is about eight minutes subsequent to
the generating event corresponding to that appearance of the sun. In the
case of other astronomical phenomena the discrepancy is more glaring. In
the case of terrestrial perceptual objects the discrepancy is less
glaring in many cases, though for sounds it is very insistent and is the
reason of their very indeterminate situations. But, speaking generally
and admitting exceptions, for the greater part of ordinary domestic
perceptions the belatedness of the apparently characterised event behind
the causally characterised event is a small fraction of the percipient's
specious present.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly our knowledge of causal characters is a theory built up by
ignoring this element of delusiveness in all perceptual objects, and
then by introducing it as an additional correction in the exceptional
cases.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art61"><b><i>61. Transition from Appearance to Cause</i></b></a>.
<b>61.1</b> But how can we pass from appearance to cause, seeing that
our knowledge of nature is confined to awareness of appearance? For
example, all measurement is a measurement of appearance.
</p>
<p>
Evidently therefore causal characters can only be directly known to us
as functions of apparent characters. They are characters of characters.
For example, a quantity which we assign to a physical object as the
result of some measurement is a character of its apparent character.
</p>
<p>
<b>61.2</b> It is necessary however to avoid a misunderstanding; the
causal character of an event is not merely a function of the apparent
character of that event. It is in truth a function of the apparent
characters of all events, though in general the apparent character of
that event&mdash;or of an associated event of somewhat later
date&mdash;is the dominant element in the formation of the function. For
example, a quantity determined by measurement is a relation of the
apparent character of the event to the apparent characters of other
events. But it is the dominance of the apparent character which in
practice makes the discovery of the causal character generally possible;
for it assigns the situation of the causal character. This dominance is
merely a practical aid to the discovery of causal characters and has in
it no element of necessity. Indeed as causal characters are
progressively discovered, scientific theory assigns causal characters to
events which are destitute of apparent character&mdash;namely the events
forming the ether in empty space and time.
</p>
<p>
<b>61.3</b> So far the explanation of causal characters has exhibited
them as the outcome and issue from apparent characters, whereas the
causal idea, which is that of science, requires the causal characters
should be the origin of the apparent characters. We have to seek the
reason for this inversion of ideas.
</p>
<p>
Causal characters are much simpler than apparent characters; are more
permanent than apparent characters; and depend almost entirely on the
event itself, involving other events only (in general) as passive
conditions providing the necessary background of a whole continuum of
nature. The climb from the sense-object to the perceptual object, and
from the perceptual object to the scientific object, and from the
complex scientific object (such as the molecule) to the (temporally, in
a stage of science) ultimate scientific object (such as the electron) is
a steady pursuit of simplicity, permanence, and self-sufficiency,
combined with the essential attribute of adequacy for the purpose of
defining the apparent characters.
</p>
<p>
<b>61.4</b> The relations of sense-objects to their situations are
complex in the extreme, requiring reference to percipient events and
transmitting events. Apart from some discovery of laws of nature
regulating the associations of sense-objects, it is impossible by
unintelligent unsorted perception to form any concept of the character
of an event from the sense-objects which might be situated there for
percipients suffering from any normal or abnormal perceptions.
</p>
<p>
The first stage is the discovery of perceptual objects. These objects
are first known by the instinctive 'conveyance' of abnormal perceptions
of sense-objects associated with normally perceived sense-objects. The
test of alternative possibilities of normal perception and the discovery
of a permanent character in the association which can be expressed
independently of any particular percipient event decides between
delusive perceptual objects and physical objects.
</p>
<p>
<b>61.5</b> The introduction of physical objects enables us in
considering the characters of events to sweep aside the boundless
eccentricities of abnormal perceptions. We are still at the stage of
apparent characters, but rules have been attained, either by instinctive
practice or by the exercise of intelligence or by the interplay between
the two, by which we know what to attend to and what to discard in
judging the character of an event from the situations of sense-objects.
A physical object is the apparent character of its situation. Physical
objects are found to be 'material' objects.
</p>
<p>
<b>61.6</b> Science now intervenes with the express purpose of
exhibiting our perceptions as our awareness of the characters of events
and of relations between characters of events. All perceptions are
included in the scope of this aim of science, namely, including
abnormally perceived sense-objects and delusive perceptual objects.
</p>
<p>
<b>61.7</b> The origin of the concept of causation (in this application
of the term) is now manifest. It is that of the part explaining the
whole&mdash;or, avoiding this untechnical use of 'part' and 'whole,' it
is that of some explaining all. For the physical objects were obtained
by discarding abnormalities, and physical objects express the characters
of events, and all our perceptions (including abnormalities) arise from
awareness of these characters.
</p>
<p>
<b>61.8</b> But physical objects fail to satisfy the requirements of
science. They lack definiteness and permanence, and are not adequate for
the purposes of explanation. Now the characters of their mutual
relations disclose further permanences recognisable in events and among
these are the scientific objects. The gradual recognition of these
permanences was at first the slow product of civilised thought without
conscious direction. As regards their conscious discovery various stages
may be discerned in scientific history, which sum up the previous growth
of ideas and initiate new epochs. One stage is marked by Archimedes'
discovery of specific gravity, and another by Newton's discovery of
mass. The simplicity of what, in its relation to appearance, is so
abstract was then beginning to be discovered, and also its permanence
and self-sufficiency as a quality of events. A third stage is the
introduction of the concept of molecules and atoms by Dalton's atomic
theory. Finally there arose the concepts respecting the ether, which we
here construe as meaning the concept of events in space empty of
appearances.
</p>
<p>
<b>61.9</b> These causal characters, which are the characters of
apparent characters, are found to be expressible as certain scientific
objects, molecules and electrons, and as certain characters of events
which do not necessarily themselves exhibit any apparent characters. If
we follow the route of the derivation of knowledge from the intellectual
analysis of sensible experience, molecules and electrons are the last
stage in a series of abstractions. But a fact in nature has nothing to
do with the logical derivation of concepts. The concepts represent our
abstract intellectual apprehension of certain permanent characters of
events, just as our perception of sense-objects is our awareness of
qualities of nature resulting from the shifting relations of these
characters. Thus scientific objects are the concrete causal characters,
though we arrive at them by a route of apprehension which is a process
of abstraction. In the same way, what, in the form of a sense-object, is
concrete for our awareness, is abstract in its character of a complex of
relations between scientific objects. Thus what is concrete as causal is
abstract in its derivation from the apparent, and what is concrete as
apparent is abstract in its derivation from the causal.
</p>
<p>
The ultimate scientific objects (at present, electrons and positive
electric charges) are 'uniform' objects; and, in the limited sense of
charges in the 'occupied' events, they are also 'material' objects.
There does not appear to be any reason, other than the very natural
desire for simplicity, for the assumption that ultimate scientific
objects are uniform. Some of the atomic and 'quantum' properties of
nature may find their explanation in the assumption of non-uniform
ultimate scientific objects which would introduce the necessary
discontinuities.
</p>
<p>
<b>61.91</b> The causal character of the situation of a physical object
is the fact that this situation contains a certain assemblage of
ultimate scientific objects; namely, the fact that among the parts of
this situation are various parts which are the occupied events of these
scientific objects. The 'causal components' of a physical object are the
scientific objects which occupy parts of the situation of the physical
object, and whose total assemblage is what constitutes the qualities
which are the apparent character which is the physical object apparent
in the situation.
</p>
<p>
<b>61.92</b> An adjustment, ordinarily negligible but often important,
has to be made to allow for the belatedness of perception. Two
situations are thus involved (even although in ordinary cases they are
practically identical), namely the situation of the physical object from
an assigned percipient event, and the situation of the assemblage of

FIGURES</h2>

<p>
<a id="art62"><b><i>62. Sense-Figures</i></b></a>. <b>62.1</b> There are
two types of objects which can be included under the general name of
'figures'; objects of one type will be termed 'sense-figures,' and of
the other type 'geometrical figures.'
</p>
<p>
Figures of either type arise from the perception of the relation of
sense-objects to the properties which their situations have in respect
to their relations of extension with other events. The primary type of
figure is the sense-figure and the geometrical figure is derivative from
it.
</p>
<p>
<b>62.2</b> Every sort of sense-object will have its own peculiar sort
of sense-figure. The sense-figures associated with some sorts of
sense-objects (e.g. smells and tastes) are barely perceptible, whereas
the sense-figures associated with other sorts of sense-objects (e.g.
sights and touches) are of insistent obviousness. The condition that a
sense-object should have a figure within a given duration can be
precisely stated: A sense-object <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O">, as perceived in a situation
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/153.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma"> which extends throughout a duration <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.176ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/186.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d"> of a time-system
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, possesses a figure in <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.176ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/186.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d">, if every volume of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/153.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma">,
lying in a moment of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> inherent in <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.176ex; height: 1.593ex;" src="images/186.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d">, is congruent with
every other such volume.
</p>
<p>
Owing to the inexactitude of perception small quantitative defects from
the rigorous fulfilment of this condition do not in practice hinder the
perception of figure. Namely, the possession of sense-figure follows
from the sufficiently approximate fulfilment of this condition. The
durations which are important from the point of view of sense-figures
are those which form present durations of perceptions&mdash;in general,
those durations which are cogredient with a percipient event and are
each short enough to form one immediate present. Thus in the numerous
instances in which there is no large change within such an immediate
present, there is a perceived figure. Accordingly we can define a
sense-figure precisely as follows:
</p>
<p>
The figure, for a time-system <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, of sense-object <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> in
situation <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/153.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma"> is the relation holding, and only holding, between
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.726ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/227.svg" alt=" " data-tex="O"> and any <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-volume congruent to a member of the set of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-volumes of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/153.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma">.
</p>
<p>
This definition is only important when the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-volumes of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/153.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\sigma"> are all nearly congruent to each other; because only in that
case is this relation recognisable in perception.
</p>
<p>
<b>62.3</b> Thus, each sense-object is primarily capable of its own sort
of sense-figure and of that sort only. There are the sense-figures of
blue of one shade, and the sense-figures of blue of another shade, and
the separate sets of figures belonging to all the shades of reds and
greens and yellows. There is the set of figures of the touch of velvet,
and the set of figures of the touch of marble at particular temperatures
of hand and surface and with a particular polish of surface.
</p>
<p>
<b>62.4</b> But there is an analogy of sense-objects and this begets an
analogy of figures. For example, there is an analogy between blues of
all shades, and a corresponding analogy between their sets of figures.
Each such analogy amid sense-objects issues in an object of a type not
hitherto named. Call it the type of 'generalised sense-objects.' For
example, we can recognise blue and ignore its particular shade.
Correspondingly we can recognise a blue sense-figure, and ignore the
differences between a light-blue sense-figure and a dark-blue
sense-figure. We can go further, and recognise colour and ignore the
particular colour; and correspondingly there are recognisable
sight-figures underlying figures of particular shades of particular
colours.
</p>
<p>
<b>62.5</b> But it would be a mistake to insist on the derivation of the
generalised sense-figures from the recognition of generalised
sense-objects. In general the converse process would seem to be nearer
the truth. Namely, the analogy amid sense-figures is more insistently
perceptible than the analogy amid sense-objects; and the derivation is
as much from the generalised sense-figure to the generalised
sense-object as in the converse order.
</p>
<p>
We must go further than this. Perceptive insistency is not ranged in the
order of simplicity as determined by a reflective analysis of the
elements of our awareness of nature. Sense-figures possess a higher
perceptive insistency than the corresponding sense-objects. We first
notice a dark-blue figure and pass to the dark-blueness.
</p>
<p>
<b>62.6</b> Indeed the high perceptive power of figures is at once the
foundation of our natural knowledge and the origin of our philosophical
errors. It has led the theory of space to be annexed to objects and not
to events, and thus created the fatal divorce between space and time. A
figure, being an object, is not in space or time, except in a derivative
sense.
</p>
<p>
This perceptive power of figures carries us to the direct recognition of
sorts of objects which otherwise would remain in the region of abstract
logical concepts. For example, our perception of sight-figures leads to
the recognition of colour as being what is common to all particular
colours.
</p>
<p>
<a id="art63"><b><i>63. Geometrical Figures</i></b></a>. <b>63.1</b> The
generalisation which introduces geometrical figures is an extreme
instance of the sort of generalisation already considered. Namely,
instead of generalising from a dark-blue figure to a sight-figure, we
pass to the concept of the relation of any sense-object to the volumes
of its situation. This concept of a figure, in which any particular
sense has been lost sight of, would be entirely without any counterpart
in perception, if it were not for the fact of perceptual objects. A
perceptual object is the association in one situation of a set of
sense-objects, in general 'conveyed' by the normal perception of one of
them. The high perceptive capacity of sense-figures leads to their
association in a generalised figure, which is the geometrical figure of
the object. Indeed, the insistent obviousness of the geometrical figure
is one reason for the perception of perceptual objects. The object is
not the figure, but our awareness of it is derived from our awareness of
the figure. The reason for discriminating the perceptual object from its
figure in that situation is that the physical object persists while its
figure changes. For example, a sock can be twisted into all sorts of
figures.
</p>
<p>
<b>63.2</b> The current doctrine of different kinds of
space&mdash;tactual space, visual space, and so on&mdash;arises entirely
from the error of deducing space from the relations between figures.
With such a procedure, since there are different types of figures for
different types of sense, evidently there must be different types of
space for different types of sense. And the demand created the supply.
</p>
<p>
<b>63.3</b> If however the modern assimilation of space and time is to
hold, we must then go further and admit different kinds of time for
different kinds of sense, namely a tactual time, a visual time, and so
on. If this be allowed, it is difficult to understand how the disjecta
membra of our perceptual experience manage to collect themselves into a
common world.
</p>
<p>
For example, it would require a pre-established harmony to secure that
the visual newspaper was delivered at the visual time of the visual
breakfast in the visual room and also the tactual newspaper was
delivered at the tactual time of the tactual breakfast in the tactual
room. It is difficult enough for the plain man&mdash;such as the present
author&mdash;to accept the miracle of getting the two newspapers into
the two rooms daily with such admirable exactitude at the same time. But
the additional miracle introduced by the two times is really incredible.
</p>
<p>
The procedure of this enquiry admits the different types of figures,
but rejects the different types of space.

<br>
RHYTHMS</h2>

<p>
<a id="art64"><b><i>64. Rhythms</i></b></a>. <b>64.1</b> The theory of
percipient objects is beyond the scope of this work of which the aim is
to illustrate the principles of natural knowledge by an examination of
the data and experiential laws fundamental for physical science. A
percipient object is in some sense beyond nature.
</p>
<p>
But nature includes life; and the way of conceiving nature developed in
the preceding chapter has its bearing on biological conceptions as to
the sense in which life can be said to be thus included.
</p>
<p>
<b>64.2</b> An object is a characteristic of an event. Such an object
may be in fact a multiple relation between objects situated in various
parts of the whole event. In this case the quality of the whole is the
relationship between its parts, and the relation between the parts is
the quality of the whole. The whole event being what it is, its parts
have thereby certain defined relations; and the parts having all the
relations which they do have, it follows that the whole event is what it
is. The whole is explained by a full knowledge of the parts as
situations of objects, and the parts by a full knowledge of the whole.
Such an object is a pattern.
</p>
<p>
<b>64.3</b> The discussion of life in nature has become canalised along
certain conventional lines based upon the traditional concepts of
science. We are aware of living objects. But the phrase 'living objects'
is misleading; we should more accurately say, 'objects expressing life,'
or 'life-bearing objects.' Namely, the individual life <i>is</i>, beyond
the mere object. There is not an object which, after being known as an
object, is then in itself judged to be alive. The specific recognisable
liveliness is the recognised character of the relation of the object to
the event which is its situation. Thus to say that the object is alive
suppresses the necessary reference to the event; and to say that an
event is alive suppresses the necessary reference to the object.
</p>
<p>
<b>64.4</b> We have therefore to ask, what sort of events have life in
their relations to objects situated in them, and what sort of objects
have life in their relations to their situations? A life-bearing object
is not an 'uniform' object. Life (as known to us) involves the
completion of rhythmic parts within the life-bearing event which
exhibits that object. We can diminish the time-parts, and, if the
rhythms be unbroken, still discover the same object of life in the
curtailed event. But if the diminution of the duration be carried to the
extent of breaking the rhythm, the life-bearing object is no longer to
be found as a quality of the slice of the original event cut off within
that duration. This is no special peculiarity of life. It is equally
true of a molecule of iron or of a musical phrase. Thus there is no such
thing as life 'at one instant'; life is too obstinately concrete to be
located in an extensive element of an instantaneous space.
</p>
<p>
<b>64.5</b> The events which are associated by us with life are also the
situations of physical objects. But the physical object though essential
is not an adequate condition for its occurrence. A change in the object
almost imperceptible from the physical point of view destroys the life
in the succeeding situations of the object. The physical object, as
apparent, is a material object and as such is uniform; but when we turn
to the causal components of such an object, the apparent character of
the whole situation is thereby superseded by the rhythmic quasi-periodic
characters of a multitude of parts which are the situations of
molecules.
</p>
<p>
In an analogous way we seek for a causal character of the event which in
some way or another is apparent to us as alive, and we seek for an
expression of this causal character in terms of the causal components of
the physical object. It would seem therefore (if the analogy is to be
pursued) that apparent life in any situation has, as its counterpart in
that situation, more complex, subtler rhythms than those whose aggregate
is essential for the physical object.
</p>
<p>
<b>64.6</b> Furthermore in the physical object we have in a sense lost
the rhythms in the macroscopic aggregate which is the final causal
character. But life preserves its expression of rhythm and its
sensitiveness to rhythm. Life is the rhythm as such, Whereas a physical
object is an average of rhythms which build no rhythm in their
aggregation; and thus matter is in itself lifeless.
</p>
<p>
Life is complex in its expression, involving more than percipience,
namely desire, emotion, will, and feeling. It exhibits variations of
grade, higher and lower, such that the higher grade presupposes the
lower for its very existence. This suggests a closer identification of
rhythm as the causal counterpart of life; namely, that wherever there is
some rhythm, there is some life, only perceptible to us when the
analogies are sufficiently close. The rhythm is then the life, in the
sense in which it can be said to be included within nature.
</p>
<p>
<b>64.7</b> Now a rhythm is recognisable and is so far an object. But it
is more than an object; for it is an object formed of other objects
interwoven upon the background of essential change. A rhythm involves a
pattern and to that extent is always self-identical. But no rhythm can
be a mere pattern; for the rhythmic quality depends equally upon the
differences involved in each exhibition of the pattern. The essence of
rhythm is the fusion of sameness and novelty; so that the whole never
loses the essential unity of the pattern, while the parts exhibit the
contrast arising from the novelty of their detail. A mere recurrence
kills rhythm as surely as does a mere confusion of differences. A
crystal lacks rhythm from excess of pattern, while a fog is unrhythmic
in that it exhibits a patternless confusion of detail. Again there are
gradations of rhythm. The more perfect rhythm is built upon component
rhythms. A subordinate part with crystalline excess of pattern or with
foggy confusion weakens the rhythm. Thus every great rhythm presupposes
lesser rhythms without which it could not be. No rhythm can be founded
upon mere confusion or mere sameness.
</p>
<p>
<b>64.8</b> An event, considered as gaining its unity from the
continuity of extension and its unique novelty from its inherent
character of 'passage,' contributes one factor to life; and the pattern
exhibited within the event, which as self-identical should be a rigid
recurrence, contributes the other factor to life. A rhythm is too
concrete to be truly an object. It refuses to be disengaged from the
event in the form of a true object which would be mere pattern. What the
pattern does do is to impress its atomic character on a certain whole
event which, as one whole bearing its atomic pattern, is a unique type
of natural element, neither a mere event nor a mere object as object is
here defined. This atomic character does not imply a discontinuous
existence for a rhythm; thus a wave-length as marked out in various
positions along a train of waves exhibits the whole rhythm of the train
at each position of its continuous travel.
</p>
<p>
<b>64.9</b> The very fact of a non-uniform object involves some rhythm.
Such objects appear to our apprehension in events at certain stages of
extensive size, provided that we confine attention to those organisms
with stability of existence, each in close association with one physical
object or with one set of causal material objects. Molecules are
non-uniform objects and as such exhibit a rhythm; although, as known to
us, it is a rhythm of excessive simplicity. Living bodies exhibit rhythm
of the greatest subtlety within our apprehension. Solar systems and star
clusters exhibit rhythm of a simplicity analogous to that of molecules.
It is impossible not to suspect that the gain in apparent complexity at
the stage of our own rhythm-bearing events is due rather to our angle of
vision than to any inherent fact of nature.
</p>
<p>
There are also stray rhythms which pass over the face of nature
utilising physical objects as mere transient vehicles for their
expression. To some extent this is the case in living bodies, which
exhibit a continual assimilation and rejection of material. But the
subtlety of rhythm appears to require a certain stability of material.
</p>
<p>
<b>64.91</b> Thus the permanence of the individual rhythm within nature
is not absolutely associated with one definite set of material objects.
But the connection for subtler rhythms is very close. So far as direct
observation is concerned all that we know of the essential relations of
life in nature is stated in two short poetic phrases. The obvious aspect

<h2><a id="notes">NOTES</a></h2>

<p>
<i>Note I</i>. The whole of <a href="#part02">Part II</a>, i.e. <a
href="#chap05">Chapters V</a> to <a href="#chap07">VII</a>, suffers from
a vagueness of expression due to the fact that the implications of my
ideas had not shaped themselves with sufficient emphasis in my mind. In
the first place every entity is an abstraction and presupposes certain
systematic types of relatedness to other things. There is no such thing
as an entity which could be real on its own, though it happens to be
related to other things. Again the development of these chapters
presupposes that philosophy, even modern philosophy, has been unduly
influenced by the Aristotelian categories, in particular those of
substance, quantity, quality, despite the criticism to which these
categories have been subjected. A detailed analysis of the complex
notions which are concealed in the terms quantity and quality is
required, but it cannot be given in a note. It was for this reason that
I avoided terms such as 'Universal' which presuppose an outlook which is
here repudiated. But in many respects the statement that an object is a
universal does explain what I mean. Particularity attaches to events and
to historical routes among events. But there is a flux of things
transcending that of nature&mdash;in the narrow sense in which nature is
here construed. Accordingly particularity cannot be confined to natural
events. The whole subject requires fuller and more systematic treatment
which I hope in the immediate future to undertake. The main point hinges
onto the
ingression<a id="FNanchor_10_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
of objects into social entities, and onto the analysis of the process
of the realisation of social entities.
</p>
<p>
In the list of objects in <a href="#art13.2">&sect; 13.2</a>, I was
distinguishing the percipient object, which roughly speaking is an
individual, as mental, from a percipient event which is the flux of
experience of a living organism. But the percipient object is shadowy in
this book and is clearly outside 'nature.'
</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nind">
<a id="Footnote_10_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_1"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>Cf. my <i>Concept of Nature</i> for a short introduction to the meaning
of this term.</p></div>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Note II</i>. The book is dominated by the idea
[cf. <a href="#art14.1">&sect; 14.1</a>] that the relation of extension has
a unique preeminence and that everything can be got out of it. During the
development of the theme, it gradually became evident that this is not
the case, and cogredience [cf. <a href="#art16.4">&sect; 16.4</a>] had
to be introduced. But the true doctrine, that 'process' is the
fundamental idea, was not in my mind with sufficient emphasis. Extension
is derivative from process, and is required by it.
</p>
<p>
This failure to insist properly on 'process' is the reason for the
paradoxical air attaching to the statement that 'objects are only
derivatively in space and time by reason of their relations to events'
[cf. <a href="#art15.2">&sect; 15.2</a>]. Objects are of course
essential for process, as appears clearly enough in the course of any
analysis of process. But it is evident that particular times cannot
result from the mere relations between objects which are at all times;
and analogously for space. Accordingly space and time must result from
something in process which transcends objects.
</p>
<p>
But natural objects require space and time, so that space and time
belong to their relational essence without which they cannot be
themselves.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="#art15.4">&sect; 15.4</a> it is pointed out that it is viâ
objects that the concept of possibility has application. This suggestion
requires further elaboration which cannot be attempted here. Similarly
in <a href="#art15.8">&sect; 15.8</a>, it is pointed out that continuity
is derived from events, and atomicity from objects. This also requires
development. It must suffice for the moment to suggest that a scientific
object is an atomic structure imposed upon the continuity of events.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#part02">Part II</a> should be read in connection with
<a href="#part04">Part IV</a> at the end of the book.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Note III</i>. <a href="#chap06">Chapter VI</a> is made clearer by
noting that the present duration [cf. <a href="#art16.2">&sect; 16.2</a>]
is primarily marked out by the significance of an interconnected display
of sensa and of other associated objects immediately apparent. The duration
is the realisation of a social entity in which the sense-objects and
perceptual objects [cf. <a href="#art23.9">&sect; 23.9</a>] are ingredient.
</p>
<p>
The antecedent physical objects [cf. <a href="#art24.5">&sect; 24.5</a>]
and scientific objects [cf. <a href="#art25">&sect; 25</a>] which
occasion the duration to be what it is are another story, and the
persistent habit of muddling the two sets of entities in
philosophy&mdash;following the lead of language&mdash;is the origin of
much confusion. For example there are four distinct meanings according
to which you can speak of a chair; you may mean (i) a collection of
sense-data, or (ii) a perceptual object, or (iii) a physical object, or
(iv) a collection of scientific objects, such as molecules or electrons.
</p>
<p>
It will be noted that I now make a distinction between perceptual
objects and physical objects, contrary to <a href="#art24.5">&sect;
24.5</a>. Thus a physical object is a social entity resulting from
scientific objects, and halfway towards a perceptual object.
</p>
<p>
Physical objects and scientific objects are causal characters which are
discussed in <a href="#chap16">Chapter XVI</a>. Also sense-objects and
perceptual objects are the apparent characters discussed in that
chapter. But the separation between the apparent and the causal must not
be over stressed: it is relative to a deliberately limited point of
view.
</p>
<p>
The whole of <a href="#art23">&sect; 23</a> would be made clearer by the
use of the term 'ingression' for the complex relation of a sense-object
to the other factors of nature which make up a social entity in process
of realisation. The over-simplification involved in the Aristotelian
concept of 'quality-subject' has obscured the analysis of ingression.
</p>
<p>
Also <a href="#art24">&sect; 24</a> is confused by a wavering between
the 'class-theory' of perceptual objects and the 'control-theory' of
physical objects, and by the confusion between perceptual and physical
objects. I do not hold the class-theory now in any form, and was
endeavouring in this book to get away from it. In
<a href="#chap16">Chapter XVI</a> the 'causal character' is identical with
the perceptual object so far as immediate perception is concerned, with
the physical object so far as further discrimination of the significance
of immediate appearance is concerned, and with scientific objects so far
as more detailed analysis is concerned.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Note IV</i>. The attempt in <a href="#art33">&sect; 33</a> to define
a duration merely by means of its unlimitedness is a failure. In a note
to the <i>Concept of Nature</i>, I point out that there is an analogous
unlimitedness through time, corresponding to the spatial unlimitedness
of a duration. Both unlimitednesses arise from the uniform significance
of spatial extension for one, and of temporal extension for the other.
Thus there is a temporal unlimitedness arising from a stationary event
[cf. <a href="#art41">&sect; 41</a>] in a definite space-time system. A
point-track is the outcome of such an unlimitedness deprived of all
spatial extension. But of course a point-track is a mere limit arrived
at by the method of extensive abstraction. But I still hold to
<a href="#art35.4">&sect; 35.4</a>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Note V</i>. In <a href="#art47">&sect; 47</a> the concept of
normality is explained with unnecessary elaboration. Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.406ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\alpha}">

through <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">, belonging to the space-time system <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">, and an

This conception is diagrammatically illustrated [but not exactly
represented] by the annexed diagram in which two dimensions have been
lost. Thus the three-dimensional regions <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.406ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\alpha}"> and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.288ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/414.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\beta}"> are represented by two straight lines. These lines also
represent [with full dimensions] two rects <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.114ex; height: 1.65ex;" src="images/432.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{\beta}"> and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.232ex; height: 1.357ex;" src="images/212.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{\alpha}"> in <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.406ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\alpha}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.288ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/414.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\beta}"> respectively: the
genesis of these rects will be explained below. The two-dimensional
'level' <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.407ex; height: 1.625ex;" src="images/430.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\pi_{\alpha\beta}"> is represented by the single
event-particle <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> which lies in it: <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 2.35ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/400.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p_{\alpha}"> is the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-point-track through <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">, and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.231ex; height: 1.65ex;" src="images/431.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p_{\beta}"> the

The plane of the paper is the two-dimensional matrix containing all the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-point-tracks through event-particles on <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.231ex; height: 1.65ex;" src="images/431.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p_{\beta}">, and
all the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-point-tracks through event-particles on
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 2.35ex; height: 1.439ex;" src="images/400.svg" alt=" " data-tex="p_{\alpha}">. This matrix intersects <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.406ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\alpha}"> in the rect
<img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.114ex; height: 1.65ex;" src="images/432.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{\beta}">, and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.288ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/414.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\beta}"> in the rect <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.232ex; height: 1.357ex;" src="images/212.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{\alpha}">.
</p>
<p>
Then the rect <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.114ex; height: 1.65ex;" src="images/432.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{\beta}"> is perpendicular to the level, or
instantaneous plane it <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.407ex; height: 1.625ex;" src="images/430.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\pi_{\alpha\beta}">, where both <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.114ex; height: 1.65ex;" src="images/432.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{\beta}">
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.407ex; height: 1.625ex;" src="images/430.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\pi_{\alpha\beta}"> lie in the three-dimensional instantaneous
space <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.406ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\alpha}">; also analogously for the rect <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.232ex; height: 1.357ex;" src="images/212.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{\alpha}"> and
the level <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.407ex; height: 1.625ex;" src="images/430.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\pi_{\alpha\beta}"> in <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.288ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/414.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\beta}">. Thus the system of
levels parallel to <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.407ex; height: 1.625ex;" src="images/430.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\pi_{\alpha\beta}"> in <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.406ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\alpha}"> is a system
of instantaneous planes in <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.406ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\alpha}"> perpendicular to the system of
rects in <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.406ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\alpha}"> parallel to <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 2.114ex; height: 1.65ex;" src="images/432.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r_{\beta}">. This pair of systems
reflects in <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.406ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/406.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M_{\alpha}"> the relation between the system of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-moments to the system of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-point-tracks. Thus the
geometry of an instantaneous moment expresses the relations of the
event-particles of the moment to the whole bundle of alternative
time-systems.
</p>
<p>
In this connection it may be well to expand the substance of a paragraph
[pp. 89, 90] in the <i>Concept of Nature</i>:&mdash;An instantaneous
point is an event-particle. It has two aspects. In one aspect it is
there, where it is, in relation to the moments of the various space-time
systems of the whole bundle of such systems. This aspect is expressed by
the definition of a punct, which is determined by the individual moments
(one from each space-time system) which contain it. The indivisibility
of a point is expressed by the fact that any moment either contains the
whole punct or contains nothing of the punct: the three-dimensionality
of space, with time as a fourth dimension, is expressed by the fact that
a punct is defined by four moments [not exceptionally related]: the
position of the punct is expressed by those moments which do contain it.
In another aspect a point is got at as a limit by indefinitely
diminishing the dimensions of circumambient space-time. This aspect of
absence of dimensions is expressed by the definition of an
event-particle by means of abstractive sets with a certain quality of
primeness in relation to puncts.
</p>
<p>
The intimate connection of geometry with the properties of the bundle of
space-time systems is thus illustrated by the characters of
instantaneous points, planes, and lines, and by the origin of
parallelism and normality. Geometry expresses in three-dimensions these
qualities of the four-dimensional space-time continuum.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
